Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.\\nLytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.\\nThe goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:\\n\\nOur Approach\\nDefine: Relationships Between Identifiers\\n\\nProfile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.\\nTo build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:\\nConstruct: Complex Profiles\\n\\nData is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.\\nAnswering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:\\nMaintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles\\n\\nOver time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.\\nLytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:\\nAdvanced Concepts\\nThe Lytics Identity Graph\\nBehind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.\\nTo create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected\\nWhen evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Graph Mechanics\\nAs you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.\\nHowever, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.\\nIn graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors.\\nIn Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.\\nIdentity Keys\\nAs we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.\\nFor example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Field Types\\nField types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.\\nUsing an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.\\nIdentity Key Rankings\\nThe ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.\\nImagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules.\\nThe ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A andnotthe profile for Email B.\\nGraph Compaction\\nWe mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.\\nIn Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.\\nCompaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.\\nRank-based Compaction\\nLet's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.\\nUpdatedover 1 year ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent\\nTitle: Consent & Privacy\"),\n",

This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined:\\nBy following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust.\\nData Collection\\nTo maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following:\\nTo address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized viaConductorto meet your specific needs.\\nData Structure\\nEffective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.\\nExamples\\n📘We are here to help!\\nWe are here to help!\\nConsent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.\\nLytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:\\nCollecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTag\\nCollecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDK\\n📘\\nWhen using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent.\\nProfile Materialization\\nBuilding from the collection strategy outlined inCollecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.\\nGranularity\\nWhen collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case.\\nFor example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy.\\nObtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.\\nSchema\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Schema\\nEnforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation.\\nField Definition\\nWhen defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as astringor amapand how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched?\\nType StringBecause consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, thelatestmerge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content='Type MapFor a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, themergemerge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win.\\n\\nMapping Definition\\nMappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related tomarketing-consent.\\nThough this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation.\\n\\nSegmentation\\nBusinesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing \"building block\" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead.\\nBuilding Blocks\\nBuilding Block Audiences provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a \"has consented\" and \"has not consented\" counterpart for each level of consent.\\nThis can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below:\\n\\nCampaign Segments\\nOnce you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in.\\n\\nGlobal Job Segment Filter (Consent)\\nConfigure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream.\\nAPI documentation can be foundhere.\\nUpdated5 months ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive\\nTitle: Client & Server Side Cookies'),\n",

This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences.\\nThird-party\\nThird-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.\\nCommon Cookie Use Cases\\nSession management\\nLogins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.\\nPersonalization\\nUser preferences, themes, and other settings.\\nTracking\\nRecording and analyzing user behavior.\\nHow does Lytics use cookies?\\nCookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our_uidor, in some casesseeridas a first-party cookie.\\nCreating & Managing Cookies\\nWhere do cookies come from?\\nIn web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.\\nWhen someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.\\nLike with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.\\nWhen someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc.\\nCookie Ingredients\\nDefines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.\\nThe stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.\\nIndicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. SeeDatefor the required formatting.\\nIndicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.\\nDefines the host to which the cookie will be sent.\\nIndicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send theCookieheader.\\nThis indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with theHTTPS:scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant toman-in-the-middle attacks.\"),\n",

Note that a cookie created withHttpOnlywill still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when callingXMLHttpRequest.send()orfetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).\\nControls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).\\nWho’s taking away my cookies?!?\\nIn June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature calledIntelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:\\nAs a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.\\nWhat can I do to replace my cookies?\\nWith each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:\\n1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy.\\nThere is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.\\n2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution.\\nThough third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.\\n3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window.\\nOver the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.\\nGetting Technical with Server Side Cookies\\nIn general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is theHttpOnlyattribute.\\nhttps://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content='https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/\\nAs a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverageHttpOnlycookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.\\nServer Side Cookie without HttpOnly\\nThe following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using therandomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case.\\nOnce you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name.\\nSince non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.\\nServer Side Cookie with HttpOnly\\nSetting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing.\\nMuch like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is settinghttpOnlyto true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution.\\nAll code examples in this document are purely for demonstration. Any customer facing implementation should follow the guidance of our customer facing technical teams and the technical experts on our customer’s end. These examples in production represent HIGH risk as documented.\\nUpdated12 months ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"URL: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution\\nTitle: Identity Resolution\\n\\n\\nIdentity Resolution\\nIntroduction\\nIdentity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.\\nLytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.\\nThe goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:\\n\\nOur Approach\\nDefine: Relationships Between Identifiers\\n\\nProfile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.\\nTo build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:\\nConstruct: Complex Profiles\\n\\nData is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.\\nAnswering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:\\nMaintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles\\n\\nOver time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.\\nLytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:\\nAdvanced Concepts\\nThe Lytics Identity Graph\\nBehind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.\\nTo create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected\\nWhen evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Graph Mechanics\\nAs you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.\\nHowever, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.\\nIn graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors.\\nIn Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.\\nIdentity Keys\\nAs we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.\\nFor example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Field Types\\nField types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.\\nUsing an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.\\nIdentity Key Rankings\\nThe ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.\\nImagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules.\\nThe ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A andnotthe profile for Email B.\\nGraph Compaction\\nWe mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.\\nIn Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.\\nCompaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.\\nRank-based Compaction\\nLet's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.\\nUpdatedover 1 year ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/pipeline\\nTitle: Data Pipeline\\n\\n\\nData Pipeline\\nWelcome to the Pipeline & Profiles section, where we will explore data management and analysis fundamentals.

Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand.\\nInitially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.\\nAs you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.\\nTo provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs:Intelligence,Audiences, andDetails.\\nAnatomy of a User Profile\\nIntelligence\\nThe intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels:Likelihood to re-engage,Current engagement level, andFrequency of user interactions.\\n\\nEach of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms.

Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require.\\nLytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users.\\n📘\\nAccess the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding theAudiencestab and clickingAudiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the+ Create New Audiencebutton.\\nBuilding Audiences: Existing Audiences\\nTheExisting Audiencestab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior.\\nKeep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list arenotreal-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data.\\nYou can use theFilter by Audience Typedrop-down to filter the list or use theSearchbox to quickly find an audience by name.\\n\\nSelect an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing.\\n\\nBuilding Audiences: Content Affinity\\nTheContent Affinitytab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. SinceAffinitiesare agroup of related Topics, this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products.'),\n",

The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users withAny Affinityare selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of theAffinitybuttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column.\\nAs soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it\\'s recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign.\\nTopic-Based Audiences\\nUnder theCustom Ruletab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows:\\nOnce you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this:\\nAlthough Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting.\\nSome users may find a field namedInferred Content Affinitywhen trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about ourcontent taxonomy process. Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user\\'s affinity.\\nBuilding Audiences: Custom Rules\\nTheCustom Rulestab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on auser fieldto the audience being built or edited.\\nCustom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation.\\n🚧Audiences Field Value Limits\\nAudiences Field Value Limits\\nAudiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field.\\nWhen exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert:\\n\\nThe user field list displays all the fields in your account. TheSourcedrop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. TheIncludesdrop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use theSearchinput to search for a user field by name.\\nGenerally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition:\\nThere are variations to this general procedure based on thetypeof the user field and the operator chosen.\\nUser Field Types\\nHow you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\lytics.txt'}, page_content=\"Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed.\\nExamples:\\n\\nText User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match.\\nThere are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields:\\nExamples\\n\\nDate user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a directionin timefor your custom rule.\\nYour starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups).\\nSince each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time.\\nSome date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule.\\nExamples\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSet user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently.\\nExamples\\n\\nMap user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance,Events By Deviceis a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field.\\nSelecting a Key\\n\\nBuilding the Condition\\nExamples\\nOut of the Box Custom Rules\\nSome user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules.\\nAssuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' webLQLfile that is automatically created when theLytics Javascript Tagis installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences.\\n\\nThere are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on anIterable Experienceemail, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on anExperience.\\nBuilding Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets\\nAll audience definitions are comprised of rules based onexisting audiences,content affinity,campaigns, andcustom rules. You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option toAdd New RuleorAdd New Rule Set. Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target.\\nWorking With Multiple Rules\\n\\nThis audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristicBehavior: Perusers.

Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users whodo notmeet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0.\\n\\n\\nWorking With Rule Sets\\nWhen building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either anANDor anORis not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using anANDor anOR.\\n\\nThis audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristicEmail Capture Status: Known Email. The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity forMarketingORAdvertisingcontent.

Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand.\\nInitially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.\\nAs you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.\\nTo provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs:Intelligence,Audiences, andDetails.\\nAnatomy of a User Profile\\nIntelligence\\nThe intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels:Likelihood to re-engage,Current engagement level, andFrequency of user interactions.\\n\\nEach of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics.\"),\n",

Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access.\\nThere are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis.\\nAs part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs.\\nOur Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer.\\nYou can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed.\\nSimilar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager.\\nLytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.

The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions:\\nInsights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood.\\nThis is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role.

By understanding how users interact with your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences.\\nActivating against Lytics Behavioral Scores\\nUser engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement.\\nBelow are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience hashigherbehavioral scores (anything above 50) orlowerbehavioral scores (anything below 50).\\nTargeting Users with Low Engagement\\nThere are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions.\\nTargeting Users with High Engagement\\nWhen creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences.\\nYou can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies.\\nActivating against Lytics Content Affinity\\nGiving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.\\nUpdatedover 1 year ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences\\nTitle: Importing External Experiences'),\n",

You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences.\\nWhile you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported.\\nCentralize cross-channel reporting\\nLytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of  your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard.\\nTo start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps.\\nMonitor Experiences via batch import\\nOn your Lytics dashboard, navigate toExperiences, and selectAdd Experiences > Import.\\nSelect your provider\\nThe Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers.

Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID.\\nImport Experiences\\nFinally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it\\'s recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases.\\n\\nCompleted experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously \"ended\", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import.\\nConnect Experiences with Lytics audiences\\nOnce you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization.An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign.

If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out thenew documentation.\\nLytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingAuth0as a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly.\\nBehind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.\\nService Provider Configuration\\nTo configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided toLytics Support:\\nFurther configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0.\\nIdP Configuration\\nAfter Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider,Lytics Supportwill provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are:\\nWith this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.\\nTesting SSO\\nOnce all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.\\nDuring the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.\\nIf requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account.\\nTroubleshooting SSO\\nIf it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.\\nFor instance, if the email listed in the IdP isabc@123, and within Lytics it’sdef@456, then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email addressabc@123for the SSO login to be successful.\\nIt should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:\\nLytics Supportcan assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side.\"),\n",

Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement.\\nBelow are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience hashigherbehavioral scores (anything above 50) orlowerbehavioral scores (anything below 50).\\nTargeting Users with Low Engagement\\nThere are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions.\\nTargeting Users with High Engagement\\nWhen creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences.\\nYou can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies.\\nActivating against Lytics Content Affinity\\nGiving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.\\nUpdatedover 1 year ago\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",

Along the way, youâ\\x80\\x99ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.\\nThis is not a complete guide to all of mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for in-depth docs, head to ourDevelopersorGuidessections.\\nThe tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.\\nLater on in this guide, youâ\\x80\\x99ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.\\nOne of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.\\nInputs include:\\nTo get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.\\nThe first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.\\nmParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:\\nMost anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment donâ\\x80\\x99t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.\\nYou need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for theiOS,AndroidorJavascriptSDKs to get set up before continuing.\\nFor the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate toSetup > Inputsin the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.\\nExpand theAdvanced Settingsby clicking the + icon.\\niOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their deviceâ\\x80\\x99s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.'),\n",

However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.\\nFollowing are descriptions of Apple and Googleâ\\x80\\x99s policies for device advertising IDs:\\nAfter the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request usersâ\\x80\\x99 explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Appleâ\\x80\\x99s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiersin their documentation.\\nFor more information about the ATT framework, visit theiOS 14 Guide.\\nGoogle allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devicesâ\\x80\\x99 advertising IDs. Similar to Appleâ\\x80\\x99s policy, Google will set a userâ\\x80\\x99s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Googleâ\\x80\\x99s advertising identifiers intheir documentation.\\nThe Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.\\nWhenCollect Integration-Specific Identifiersis checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebookâ\\x80\\x99sfbcandfbpfields.\\nIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:\\nCongratulations, you have created a working data input.

Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in theDebug Console.\\nIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t see data arriving in the output service, navigate toData Master > Live Streamand select Message Direction Outbound.\\nIf you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:\\nIf the previous step doesnâ\\x80\\x99t resolve the issue:\\nIf there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting to send any data to the output service.

This can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios.\\nYou can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.\\nWhen you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform.  You can also enrich that data stream with other data sources.  For example, in addition to sending app data, you may want to send in data that is not collected in the app (server side data) and have the mParticle platform match the data based on a user identifier, and then create audiences based upon this superset of data.  Examples of data sent server side might include CRM data, purchase or revenue data from other non-mobile channels.  Make sure all the data that you need is captured is important; audience creation is the first step.\\nUse audiences to drive user engagement, encourage app downloads, and more.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s say you want to engage with users that have recently installed your app but havenâ\\x80\\x99t used your app very much.  Your objective is to drive higher engagement and convert those new users to high lifetime value users.  You want to accomplish this across multiple channels: push notification and email.  Therefore, your audience qualification criteria is that the user has installed your app in the last 72 hours and has less than three sessions.\\nYou can easily and visually define this audience, then configure audience integrations to push notification and email partners - in this example, letâ\\x80\\x99s use Button for push and Mailchimp for email.  Once you configure the respective integrations, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audience in Button and updates the corresponding email marketing list in Mailchimp.  No coding is necessary.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.\\nOnce your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.  From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.\\nBecause we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.\\nmParticle provides two types of audiences:\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",

A rule is a script which accepts an incoming mParticle Events API â\\x80\\x9cbatchâ\\x80\\x9d object and modifies it according to your business logic. Some example use-cases for a rule are:\\nEach of your Inputs, such as for your web, mobile, or server-to-server data, has an individually configured data pipeline, and each Inputâ\\x80\\x99s pipeline contains the same key stages. Rules are therefore applied for a specific Inputâ\\x80\\x99s pipeline, and itâ\\x80\\x99s up to you choose where in that Inputâ\\x80\\x99s pipeline each Rule is executed. A single Input pipeline may contain multiple Rules each stage.\\nStage 1 - Input\\nData is received by mParticle for a specific Input (such as Web, iOS, or a custom server feed).\\nStage 2 - Storage and Processing\\nThe Inputâ\\x80\\x99s data is stored and processed by mParticle, including:\\nStage 3 - Output\\nThe Inputâ\\x80\\x99s data is sent individually to the mParticle Audience system and 300+ partner integrations. In this stage the pipeline actually branches out with a single Input potentially being connected to many Outputs.\\nRules are applied to a specific Inputâ\\x80\\x99s pipeline. There are two places in the pipeline where rules can be applied:\\nIn between Stage 1 and Stage 2\\nRules executed between Stage 1 and Stage 2 affect the data sent to both Stage 2 and then Stage 3, including the mParticle profile store, audience store, and all outputs. These are labeled â\\x80\\x9cAll Outputâ\\x80\\x9d Rules in your mParticle dashboard.\\nIn between Stage 2 and Stage 3\\nYou can also apply a rule right before itâ\\x80\\x99s sent to aspecificOutput. This lets you mutate data to handle specific requirements or mappings that need to occur for a given partner integration.\\nRules are executed on the server and only act on data forwarded downstream server-to-server. A warning is shown in the dashboard if you set up one of the following rules:\\nmParticle rules are hosted in your AWS account as Lambda functions. To do this, you need to be able to provide an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) for your rule. See theAWS Lambda documentationfor help creating a function.

There is no default action, you must select one of the following:\\nRegardless of which option you choose, itâ\\x80\\x99s best practice to handle all exceptions in your code, rather than falling back on the above defaults. This is especially true if your rule deals with events, where an unhandled exception from just one event could lead to all events in the batch being dropped.\\nYour code must be a validLambda function.\\nThe first time you test a rule, you are asked to provide a name, description and failure action. After naming a rule, you can test it by using one of the sample templates provided in the Test rule dialog. You can also copy and paste batch JSON from your Live Stream. If you do this, be sure to pick a full batch to copy, not a single event.  ClickTestto run. Optionally, check a box to save your JSON template in local storage for future testing.\\nYou must enter validbatchJSON in the code editor.\\nIf there are any syntactical errors in your code, warning or error icons will display next to the line number with details of the problem so you can correct.\\nAfter clickingTest, you can examine the JSON output from your function to see that the input has been modified as expected.\\nAfter a successful test you can clickSaveto save the Rule. Due to recent updates in AWS Lambda, it may be necessary to wait one minute after a successful test in order to save the Rule.\\nIf your test fails, try examining thelogsfor any console output.\\nWhen you first create a rule, by default it will only be applied toDEVdata. As well as testing a rule with sample JSON you should test the rule in your dev environment to make sure data reaching your output services is as expected. When you are ready to apply a rule to your production data, clickPromote to Prodon the rule page. This will create a â\\x80\\x9cv1â\\x80\\x9d production rule.\\nNote that before a rule can be promoted to Prod, you must remove allconsole.log()statements.\\nIf you need to make changes, choose$LATESTfrom theVersiondropdown. All other versions are read only. Test your changes with your dev environment and, when you are ready, clickPromote to Prodto create â\\x80\\x9cv2â\\x80\\x9d of your production rule.\\nNote that you can have a maximum of 50 versions per rule. If you have too many versions, select a version and click the trash can icon to the right of the version number to delete it.\\nEach rule has a master switch in the Settings panel. If there is a problem with your rule, you can switch it off and it will be disabled for all connections until you enable it again. To disable, clickEditin the right sidebar and set theStatusslider toinactive.\\nThe following metrics are available:\\nThese metrics are for the last 24 hours and apply to all connections. Summaries for each rule can be seen on the main rules page. Detailed graph of the previous 24 hours is available on theMonitoringtab of the individual rule page.\\n\\nTo help you with troubleshooting rules, mParticle maintains logs for each rule where you can view all console output. From an individual rule page, select theLogstab. You can filter messages by date range or search for keywords.\\n\\nFrom the rules listing, select theDeleteaction to delete the rule.

Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.\\nConsent state can be logged via the HTTP API simply by including a consent state object in a batch, mirroring the structure of the user profile (above):\\nFor detailed definitions of how to report consent state, review the sections of our API and SDK references that cover data privacy controls:\\nAdditionally, ourintegration with OneTrustallows you to ingest customer consent states into mParticle.\\nConsent state is maintained per person on the User Profile using the structure defined above.\\nFor testing consent, you can useUser Activity Viewto check that a consent was recorded correctly. Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:\\n\\nConsent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a usersâ\\x80\\x99 consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.\\nFor example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:\\n\\nFor GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as â\\x80\\x98Advertisingâ\\x80\\x99:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='For GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as â\\x80\\x98Advertisingâ\\x80\\x99:\\n\\nConsent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.\\nFor example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.\\nFor CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, usersâ\\x80\\x99 who have a consent state oftruefor the CCPA purpose ofdata_sale_opt_outwill NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):\\nFor GDPR, you may want a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:\\nIf you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.\\nWhen the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If theconsent_stateobject on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a â\\x80\\x98system notificationâ\\x80\\x99 to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sent to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:\\nThere are currently two ways that consent state changes are forwarded to mParticle event integrations:\\nSome partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the â\\x80\\x98system_notificationsâ\\x80\\x99 object with each relevant event batch. Forwarding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:\\nmParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of\"Consent\", and an event name of\"Consent Given\"or\"Consent Rejected\". These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.\\nPartners that currently accept these custom consent state events include:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGDPR Consent Changeâ\\x80\\x9d is  listed as a data type in theIntegrations directoryand we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.\\nmParticle helps you respond todata subject requestsas mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.\\nYou can search for integrations that support data subject requests in theIntegrationspage. Search on categoryData Subject Request.\\nThe California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingestGlobal Privacy Control (GPC) signalswith mParticle.\\nBrowsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryable via the DOM. This signal is designed to convey a personâ\\x80\\x99s request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, perthe Global Privacy Control specification. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.\\nThe workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:'),\n",

Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.\\nmParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.\\nTo keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the web SDK and a sample ecommerce app built using React calledThe Higgs Shop.\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s Web SDK supports commonly used web browsers, connected TVs, and other client-side environments using JavaScript and TypeScript.\\nBy initializing the Web SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your appâ\\x80\\x99s code to send events and user data to mParticle.\\nIn order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.\\nThis tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample web application built using React.\\nNext >> Create an input\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",

Files must follow the guidelines in this section.\\nFiles must be sent in one of the following formats:\\nFile name requirements:\\nColumn names: specify fields according to ourJSON Schema, using dot notation.\\nUser and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.\\nDevice IDs\\nUser IDs\\nUser attributes:\\nIf you include user attributes, for each, include a column named asuser_attributes.key, wherekeyis a user attribute key. For example:\\nAttribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in theJSON Referenceare supported.\\nEvents:\\nCommerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.\\nOnly one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.\\nData types:\\nAll data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.\\nmParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.\\nUse the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.\\nTo get your SFTP username and password:\\nConfigure the Custom CSV Feed as input.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='If you are new to setting up Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s Mobile App Analytics, your best place to start is Mixpanel itself and the below are must-reads before proceeding:\\nWhen mParticle sends data to Mixpanel, Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s APIs are utilized.  This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.\\nIn order to enable mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s integration with Mixpanel, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic,Find Project Token.\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s SDK supports nearly all of the Mixpanel SDK specific features natively. When you use the mParticle SDK, mParticle events will be transformed using Mixpanel-compliant naming conventions and activate the corresponding features automatically.\\nOne of the key features of Mixpanel is funnel tracking, this feature requires a consistent approach to identifying your users as they sign up, and progress from being only identifiable by their device, to having a unique â\\x80\\x9clogged inâ\\x80\\x9d ID.\\nmParticle manages this process using itsIDSync feature. IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintains a hierarchy of different ID types.\\nA traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:\\nIf your project has Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99sID Mergefeature enabled, the call toidentifywill connect pre- and post-authentication events when appropriate.\\nIf your project does not have ID Merge enabled,identifywill change the userâ\\x80\\x99s local distinct_id to the unique ID you pass. Events tracked prior to authentication will not be connected to the same user identity. If ID Merge is disabled,  Alias can be used to tie the original Distinct ID (an anonymous device ID) and the new Distinct ID (a unique User ID) together in Mixpanel.\\nIf this process is not followed correctly, funnel tracking wonâ\\x80\\x99t be possible, as Mixpanel will see the two Distinct IDs as two completely separate users.\\nIf you wish to use Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s funnel tracking features, here is one option for implementing with mParticle:\\nThis option is recommended for new implementations.This option lets your Mixpanel user profiles mirror those maintained by mParticle. This option lets your mParticle Identity strategy take care of aliasing for you, before your data ever reaches Mixpanel.\\nFor this to work, you need to have selected an Identity Strategy that supports funnel tracking, such as theProfile Conversion Strategy. If you use the Profile Conversion Strategy and mParticleâ\\x80\\x99sCustomer IDas your logged-in ID type, a sign-up flow works as follows:\\nTo use this option, set theExternal Identity TypetomParticle IDin theConfiguration Settings.\\nNote that this example is the minimum necessary to demonstrate the required sign-up flow and does not include additional features, such as completion handlers. Refer to the full Identity documentation:\\nTo support each feature in theSupported Featurestable above, multiple methods will need to be implemented. The following table shows the mapping between each feature and SDK methods.\\nTracking standard events in the mParticle SDK is fairly straightforward. Events can be standalone or include event attributes. mParticle attributes are converted to Mixpanel properties automatically when forwarded.\\nmParticle sends data to different Mixpanel endpoints depending on the age of the events:\\nSuper properties allow certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the user rather than about a specific event, for example, the userâ\\x80\\x99s age, gender, or source. These super properties will be automatically included with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='Both Mixpanel and mParticle have the ability to set specific attributes for the user which will persist until overwritten.\\nIf you have enabled the â\\x80\\x98Include User Attributesâ\\x80\\x99 setting, then any messages with type ScreenView or AppEvent will include the email user identity (if available) and all user attributes.  TheSetUserAttributemethod can be used to set user attributes. This method will overwrite the values of any existing user attributes.\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s attribute naming conventions closely resemble standard Mixpanel attributes, which a few exceptions:\\nThese mParticle attributes will just have the leading $ removed:\\nIf these attributes are seen, they will be replaced with Mixpanel attributes:\\nWith available user identity info and user attributes, standard people data being sent includes:\\nData being sent in the $set section:\\nIn order to track revenue using mParticle and Mixpanel, you need to ensure that mParticle is forwarding on relevant data by enabling theUse Mixpanel Peoplesetting.  If the mParticle SDK method has been called to log an event, the event and one event attribute have been set up for LTV tracking, and the event is not excluded by an account policy, a transaction message will be sent to Mixpanel.\\nOnly specific data will be considered as part of the transactional funnel. Standard message data format is:\\nData being sent in the transactions section:\\nEvent batches sent to Mixpanel using the server-side web integration will also send the following data:\\nNote that this data depends on thehttp_header_user_agentfield so they will only be set if a value is included in the batch.\\nBy default, mParticle sends data to Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s US Servers, but offers an EU Data Localization option for theiringestion API, which allows data to be sent and stored in the Mixpanel EU Data Center (see Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s documentation onStoring Your Data in the European Union). This EU Residency is not automatically set within a Mixpanel project. You can find steps on how to set EU Data Localization for your Mixpanel project withinthe Mixpanel documentation.

However, Web data can be sent client or server side based on your implementation and settings.  These different options require different settings:\\nYou need to perform a few steps in Facebook to create aFacebook Pixel S2Sconnection.\\nFacebook recommends sending the same pixel event twice - once from the browser and once from the server. If done incorrectly, this can result in duplicate events appearing in Facebook.

To ensure redundant events sent through Facebook Pixel and the Facebook Conversions API are correctly deduplicated when they reach Facebook, two conditions must be met:\\nIf you use the mParticle Web SDK and server-side web integration, then this will be automatically handled.\\nIf you need to manually assign asource_message_idvia the web SDK and server-side separately, use the following API:\\nYou can also assign asource_message_idto commerce events:\\nNote that your workspace will need to be on event batching in order to leverage passing a customsource_message_idto the Web SDK for this to work.  If you are not on web batching, please contact your customer success manager.\\nVisit theFacebook Business Help CenterandFacebook For Developersfor more information on the subject of deduplication.\\nPlease run through the following steps to confirm your settings are correct:\\nIf you run into issues with either of the above steps, please repeat the steps described inConfiguring Facebook Pixel Server-to-Server.\\nThe Facebookadvertiser_tracking_enabledfield is set based on theatt_authorization_statusandlimit_ad_trackingfields as defined below.

You only need to make code changes if you directly call the Braze SDK from your code. Otherwise, you can simply selectVersion 5from the mParticle connection settings.\\nIf you are upgrading from V3, you should check the breaking changes from theBraze V4 Changelogas well asBraze V5 Changelog, in addition to theV4/5 migration guideto learn about the breaking changes.  The most significant breaking changes are the replacement of theappboyclass name withbrazefrom V3 to V4, in addition to the removal and renaming of several APIs.  If you are updating from V4 to V5, there are fewer changes, but youâ\\x80\\x99d follow the same defensive code recommendations below.\\nYou can opt into the latest major version of the Braze Web SDK whether you implement mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s Web SDK using npm or our snippet/CDN.\\nNote that the following is only one example, and demonstrates an upgrade from V3 to V5.  Everywhere you manually callappboy(or other deprecated API) needs to be updated similar to the below. If you are using NPM, you can skip to step 4.  Please be sure to test your site fully in development prior to releasing.\\nStep 2: Roll out code changes to be used before you opt in to using Version 4 of the Braze Web SDK so that it works under both versions:\\nStep 3: Whether you are using the snippet or self-hosting, you need to navigate to your Braze connection settings and selectVersion 5from theBraze Web SDK Versiondrop down.\\nStep 4: After you opt in, you can simplify your code. We recommend testing and waiting at least 24 hours between opting in and removing previous instances ofappboyand doing thorough testing of your application in a development environment to ensure everything is working:'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s integration with AppsFlyer includes a required Kit integration and an optional server-side integration. The Kit forwards event data from your app to AppsFlyer on the client side, and also handles app install attribution, uninstall tracking, and deeplinking, including deferred deeplinking. Supplementary data from outside your app can be forwarded to mParticle via our Events API and sent on to AppsFlyer server-to-server.\\nGoogle has several notions of user-provided consent.  Two of these apply to AppsFlyer events:ad_user_dataandad_personalization. These represent consent forad user dataandad personalization.\\nTo configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s platform, see the following docs:Data Privacy Controls.\\nOnce a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the User Consent Data Mapping connection setting.\\nIn the absence of a user-defined consent value for thead_user_dataandad_personalizationfields via the Consent Purpose mapping, a default value can be optionally configured via a separate drop-down setting for each consent type. When no user consent is provided, the default status is used, if specified.\\nCaution: It is recommended that in the long term, you set up user-specified consent through the Consent Purpose mapping, such that the user consent is correctly forwarded to Google. It is your responsibility as a Data Controller to stay compliant under the GDPR, and set up user consent collection for downstream forwarding. The consent default setting can be deprecated in the future.\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s AppsFlyer integration requires that you add the AppsFlyer Kit to your iOS or Android app. Just by adding the binary to your app:\\nmParticle publishes the AppsFlyer Kit as separate iOS and Android libraries which have a transitive dependency on the mParticle core libraries. You can add them to your app via Carthage, Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager, or Gradle:\\nRefer to theApple SDKandAndroid SDKguides to read more about kits.\\nAppsFlyerâ\\x80\\x99s SDK requires the forwarding of the Google Play Install Referrer Intent.

The mParticle SDK will then forward the Install Referrer intent to each configured kit, including AppsFlyer.\\nPlease see theAndroid SDK setup guideto ensure your manifest is configured properly.\\nThe AppsFlyer SDK exposes client-side deep linking and attribution APIs, all of which are supported by the mParticle AppsFlyer kit and are covered in this section. The core use-cases are:\\nEach platform has very specific requirements to ensure that the above functionality is supported. The minimum requirements are:\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s SDKs will automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK, forwarding the requiredUIApplicationlifecycle events and thecontinueUserAcivityevents for iOS and Android, as well as registering a delegate such that you can retrieve deep linking and attribution parameters on the client-side to customize your userâ\\x80\\x99s in-app experience.\\nSpecifically, the AppsFlyer SDK exposes one distinct callback:\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s API includes a wrapper for this callback, and both the iOS and Android kits expose a constant to inform you when the callback has been fired and if it was successful. On both platforms, the iOS/Android kit will register a delegate/callback with the AppsFlyer SDK on initialization and for the lifetime of the appâ\\x80\\x99s process, and will call your completion handler block (iOS) orAttributionListener(Android) whenever there is new conversion data available.'),\n",

Identities that are hashed asSHA256are noted.\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cmatch rateâ\\x80\\x9d for a Facebook audience refers to the percentage of your forwarded user data that Facebook successfully matches to active Facebook users.\\nWhen you connect an mParticle audience with Facebook, several user identifiers are included for each audience member (such as email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertiser IDs). After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.\\nThere are several factors that can impact your match rate:\\nA higher match rate means that more of your user data was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.\\nYou can use the mParticle audiences integration to create value-based lookalike audiences. These audiences target users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with your existing high-value customers.\\nHowever, unlike traditional lookalike audiences, which are based solely on demographic or interest similarities, value-based lookalike audiences are generated using an attribute that reflects the monetary value or profitability of your customers. For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.\\nBy default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if the value of their â\\x80\\x9cvalue reprepresenting attributeâ\\x80\\x9d is greater than 0. You can include values equaling zero by checkingAllow Zero Valueswhen creating your value-based audience.\\nYou can learn more about value-based lookalike audiences inFacebookâ\\x80\\x99s documentation.\\nAs of July 2, 2018, Facebook requires that all new audiences disclose whether their data was collected from customers directly, collected from partners, or both. You can provide this information in the connection settings when connecting an audience to Facebook via the Customer File Source setting.\\nYou can learn more about the Customer File Source Requirement inFacebookâ\\x80\\x99s documentation.\\nFacebook does not allow more than500 custom audiencesto be created per Facebook Ads account. If you attempt to forward more than 500 audiences to Facebook, an error will be returned.\\nThe Facebook Audience integration uses bulk forwarding. This means that instead of forwarding audience data in real time, mParticle adds updates to a queue. By default, mParticle forwards data to Facebook from this queue whenever one of the following conditions is met:\\nBefore activating your new connection, or when troubleshooting issues, please be aware of the following:\\nDuring steps 4-5 of the first stage of the setup process, you connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Make sure that you use a Facebook account that has been granted access to the Facebook Ads account you will forward your audiences to, and make sure that after connecting your Facebook account that you use theFacebook Account IDdropdown menu to select the Facebook Ads account.\\nIt is possible to have access to multiple Ads accounts, so make sure that you selected the correct Ads account when creating your output.\\nReadAccess to a Facebook Ads accountfor instructions on how to make sure your Facebook account has the correct access. If you do not have the correct access, reach out to your Facebook Ads account administrator.'),\n",

This time can vary depending on how large your audiences are.\\nAfter logging into Facebook Ads Manager, make sure that you select the correct Business Portfolio from the left-hand navbar. You should select the Business Portfolio containing the Ads Account you chose to forward your audiences to.\\nWhen you select more than one user identity to forward to Facebook, a separate audience will be created in Facebook for each identity you select.

Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.\\nBy default, mParticle uploads to Snapchat whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:\\nUpload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.\\nWhen you delete a connection or audience, the downstream segment in Snap will be deleted.\\nYou can use the mParticle audience integration to create value-based audiences with Snap. As a prerequisite, Snap must enable value-based audience support for your ad account.\\nBy default, mParticle will forward all users in a value-based audience to Snap even if their user attribute representing value is missing or negative. You can exclude users with negative, missing, and zero values by unchecking theAllow Zero And Negative Valuesconnection setting when creating your value-based audience.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/twitter/audience\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

You can tell yourBraze Instancefrom the URL of your Braze Dashboard.\\nCheck with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.\\nThere is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.\\nUsinghttps://or a trailing/in your endpoint address will cause errors.\\nmParticle will attempt to match users in Braze based on IDFAs, Android Device IDs, and a customizableExternal User ID field, which uniquely identifies a user in Braze. You can set which Identity Type to use as the External User ID in theConfiguration Settings. Your External User ID should be a unique, permanent identifier â\\x80\\x94 usually Customer ID or Email. If you are also using theEventintegration, make sure you set the same External User ID across both integrations.\\nThe Braze API does not allow mParticle to directly create and maintain membership of segments in Braze, so the Audience integration works by setting attributes on a user, which you can then use todefine a corresponding segment in Braze. Like mParticle, Braze populates itâ\\x80\\x99s Segment Manager based on the actual data points received, so you need to create audiences in mParticle and connect them to Braze first. Then, provided your audience is not empty, the segment membership attributes should become available in the Braze Segment Manager within a few minutes.\\nmParticle offers seven ways to set segment membership attributes, controlled by theSend Segments AsConfiguration Setting. The drop-down has the following options:\\nThese options will be explained in further detail below.\\nNote that Audience IDs can be found in the main Audience list view.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='For example, note the Audience IDs for these three audiences:\\nThis is the default behavior.  mParticle creates a single custom attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembership. The value of this attribute is a comma-separated string of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.\\nUsing the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipwith a value of\"\\'13053\\',\\'13052\\', \\'13051\\'\"in Braze.\\nSee theSample Braze Profilefor an example.\\nTo target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze using the mParticle Audience ID,\\nwith the filterSegmentMembershipâ\\x80\\x94matches regexâ\\x80\\x9413051. Itâ\\x80\\x99s important to choose thematches regexoption, and notequals, or users with membership in more than one audience will not be matched.\\n\\nmParticle creates a single custom array attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembershipArray. The value of this attribute is an array of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.\\nUsing the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipArraywith a value of[\"13053\",\"13052\", \"13051\"]in Braze.

When this happens, mParticle willnotupdate the audience user attributes in Braze to remove the audience from each user.\\nDeleting an audience does not remove the custom attributes in Braze.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

No information is shared across organization boundaries. mParticle creates the organization(s) for you.\\nA few features apply at the organization level, includingprofile strategies.\\nYou can think of the organization as representing your company.\\nAccount\\nEach organization has one or more accounts. Accounts often represent different functional groups or goals within an organization, for example regional divisions, or Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. mParticle creates the account(s) for you.\\nSome information is shared across accounts either by default or by enablement:\\nWorkspace\\nEach account contains one or more workspaces. A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account.  mParticle creates your first workspace, but you can add more at any time.\\nFor most use cases, each workspace is its own domain, separate from other workspaces. Some information is shared across workspace boundaries:\\nSome mParticle accounts have over a dozen workspaces, while others have only one. How you organize data from your app ecosystem is entirely up to you.\\nUse organizations, accounts, and workspaces to manage multiple brands, regions, and to manage custom identity configurations and unique input/output requirements.  You can also use mParticle features likecross-account audience sharingormultiple workspace real-time audiences.\\nTo see which accounts and organizations are available:\\nThe Best Bags company sells handbags under several different names, and in several regions of the globe. They can use organizations and workspaces to provide differentiation when needed:\\nYou can also useidentity scopeto manage how user data is shared between workspaces and accounts. And if you need to share audiences across accounts, you can request that mParticle enablecross-account audience sharingfor your organization.\\nClick on the name of your current workspace in the top-left corner of the dashboard to open the workspaces menu. From here you can switch into any of your current workspaces, or clickSettingsto open the Workspace Settings page.'),\n",

First delete or modify the multiworkspace audience, then you can delete the workspace.\\nmParticle handles Web data â\\x80\\x94 collected from a browser client â\\x80\\x94 a little differently from data collected from native apps.\\nIn most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle, and then forwarded on to integration partners server-to-server.\\nThere are exceptions to this rule: in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all the required functionality of an integration partner, an Embedded Kit may be used. Embedded Kits are extra components added to the mParticle SDK that communicate directly with an integration partner from the app client.\\nWhile direct communication between the client and partner is the exception for native apps, it is common for web data. A key reason for this is that most of mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s integration partners are not set up to receive web data server-to-server, as they rely on cookie data only accessible to the cookie owner. To support these integrations, the mParticle Web SDK uses the following workflow:\\nTo make it easier to work with web integrations, we provide the source code in a public repository, so you can work with the Integration Partnerâ\\x80\\x99s documentation and see exactly how we map mParticle methods onto the Partner code. See themparticle-integrations organizationfor a complete list of client-side web integrations.\\nmParticle imposes limits on the number and length of attributes that can be associated with events and users.\\nA quick summary of some of the most important limits is below. For more information, see our fullDefault Service Limitsguide.\\nEvents\\nUsers\\nNote that Output Services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your Output Services in theIntegration Centerto make sure you are complying with their limits.\\nBrowsers add third-party tracking protection for end users. The protections affect third-party trackers and their cookies and work in different ways. For example, Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) relies on a list of known trackers to decide what to block. Safari, Chrome for iOS and other browsers with the Apple WebKit engine use Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). ITP prevents the browser from loading cookies from a third-party domain.\\nmParticle aligns with this privacy stance.\\nmParticle ingests data points that are composed of event attributes and user attributes.\\nFor a given user, attributes are stord at the workspace level, not the device level.\\nUser attributes are ingested according to the following priority:\\nOnce ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonâ\\x80\\x99t be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to set that same value from a partner data feed.\\nWhen mParticle ingests data, there are two timestamps associated with events:\\nIf batches or events have a timestamp that is more than 15 minutes in the future, relative to the server processing the data, that timestamp will be reset to the current server UTC time. Attribute timestamps remain unchanged.\\nIf you load data using CSV Import, the batch timestamp is reset to the current server UTC time.\\nmParticle strives to be as transparent as possible. Part of this transparency is to share information about products, features, or functionality that we expect to deliver in the future.\\nForward-looking statements are as accurate as possible given the knowledge at the time of publication. However, no purchasing decisions should be made on the basis of any forward-looking statement, and mParticle may withdraw or change the products, features, or functionality mentioned in such statements.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='Some integrations allow you to choose either server-side or client-side when you configure a connection.\\nNo matter which data flow your integration uses, a connection is required. A connection is the combination of an input, an output, and the configuration information required to make the connection work. Most of the configuration information is specified in the mParticle UI, but some values may need to be fetched from the output, and you may need to add a kit to an SDK for some client-side integrations.\\nThe Connections screen controls how event data from your inputs (iOS, Android, Web, Feeds, etc) is forwarded to your output platforms. You must set up a separate connection for each input-output-configuration combination. For each connection, you have several opportunities to cleanse and filter your data, to ensure that each output receives the data you want it to receive, in the correct format.\\n\\nEach output has its own requirements, so the process for setting up each connection is a little different. However, all connections require these basic steps:\\nData flows once an input and output are connected and the connection is active. For an overview before you create your first connection, view the following video:\\n\\n1. Select an input\\n2. Apply â\\x80\\x98All Outputsâ\\x80\\x99 transformations\\nOnce you have an input selected, you can set up transformations that are applied to all outputs connected to that input.

Select an Output\\nOnce you have selected an input, you will see a list of available outputs that can receive data from your selected input. If this list is empty, go toSetup > Outputsto create some outputs.\\nThe following video shows how to create an output:\\n\\nThe mParticle UI may indicate that you need or may need to add a reference to a kit in your platform dependency configuration. You can do this after you create the connection but before you change theConnection Statusto active. SeeAdd a Kitfor more information.\\n4. Complete Connection Settings\\nComplete any settings that apply to the connection. These will be different for every output but can include:\\nThe minimum platform version of your input that the connection will forward data from.\\nIf you set theMin Platform Versionconnection setting, then mParticle will only forward data from inputs with anapplication_versionthat is equal to or greater than the version you set.

Specific output transformations include:\\nWhen you configured your output in step 3, the mParticle UI may have indicated that you do need or may need a kit added to the SDK for your app or web pages:\\nIf so, check the integration documentation for your output. If a kit is required, follow the instructions for adding the kit to your input platform dependency configuration.\\nAfter you have completed the required settings, set up any transformations, and added a kit (if needed), you are ready to activate the connection:\\nVery large data volumes may take up to 48 hours to process.

There are many reasons to do this, including:\\nUnlike other transformations, the data filter exists on its own page, separate from the Connections screen. A data filter allows you to decide which events/attributes you want to send to each output. By default, all event attributes are enabled when you first activate a connection. From the event filter you can:\\nSeeThe Data Filterfor more information.\\nLike the event filter, forwarding rules let you filter out events from being sent to an Output. But where the event filter is based on event and attribute names, forwarding rules look at values, which lets you build some more complex conditions. There are several types of forwarding rules.\\nUser Sampling is applied to a single output and sends only a subset, or sample of your data to an output. The main reason to do this is to control costs on services that charge by volume of data. Data is sampled on a user level, not an event level - if you select a 50% sample, mParticle forwards all data received from half of your users, not half of each userâ\\x80\\x99s data.\\n\\nSeeRulesfor more information about specific-output rules.\\nSome services allow your incoming events to be translated into events specific to the service. For example, if you have a custom event named â\\x80\\x9cNextLevelâ\\x80\\x9d, typically this event would be forwarded as a custom event to a service. With custom mappings, you can specify that this event be forwarded to a service using their specific event name. For example:\\nFor partners that support custom mappings, the outputâ\\x80\\x99s events are listed on the left side of theCustom Mappingstab. For each event, you can then select an mParticle event and associated attributes to map to the partnerâ\\x80\\x99s event.\\n\\nThe following integrations support custom mappings:\\nIf an event has a Custom Mapping for a particular connection, it will be displayed with an icon in the Event Filter'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='The following integrations support custom mappings:\\nIf an event has a Custom Mapping for a particular connection, it will be displayed with an icon in the Event Filter\\n\\nIf you turn off forwarding of an event with a Custom Mapping, the mapping information will be deleted.\\nThe final and most crucial transformation step is the mParticle Forwarder Module itself.\\nAfter all your other transformations have been completed, the forwarder module turns your data into messages to the output in its preferred format.\\nEach integration has its own forwarding module. Settings for the forwarder are derived from three places:\\nBased on these settings, mParticle transforms your data into a format accepted by the output. This can involve extensively reformatting the data. For example, Mixpanelâ\\x80\\x99s API accepts events, with attributes given as a flat set of key-value pairs. To fit this structure, a single mParticle eCommerce event with four products will be transformed into four Mixpanel Events - one for each product - with common attributes, such as user and device info, repeated for each event.\\nThe documentation for each integration will tell you what you need to know about how data is transformed to be accepted by the Output service.\\nmParticle provides many opportunities to transform and enrich your data. It is often possible to perform the same transformation in more than one place. For example, if you wanted to drop all Application State Transition events for a given output, you could use the event filter, or you could write a condition in an output rule. There are advantages to each choice. The event filter can be used by anyone with the appropriate access to your organization in the mParticle Dashboard, so it is easy to update and maintain. Writing a rule gives you much finer control over your data, but rules may be difficult for non-developers to understand or alter.\\nMake the necessary transformations to your data in as few steps as possible. The fewer times you alter your data, the easier your integration will be to troubleshoot and maintain.\\nTo find out more about event integrations in mParticle, view the following video:\\n\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

However, you probably donâ\\x80\\x99t wantallof your data going to every output service you use. For this reason, mParticle provides the Data Filter as a simple way to control the flow of data to your outputs.\\nThe Data Filter displays a complete list of all data points (a data point can be an event, an attribute of a user or event, or a user identifier) collected in your workspace, and allows you to disable forwarding of any individual data point to any of your output services.\\nThe following video explains data filtering in mParticle:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content=\"The first time you visit the Data Filter, you will see an empty grid. To start filtering you need to:\\nYou can filter event data at 3 levels: Event Type, Event Name and Event Attributes.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that the Data Point Filter is independent from the mParticle forwarders that handle transforming and forwarding your data to each output service. It includes switches for every data point, even if that data point is never forwarded to a particular output service. For example, Amplitude only accepts Customer ID and Email Address as User IDs. Leaving the filter switches on for other ID types will have no effect.\\nAlways check the documentation for each integration for details on what data is forwarded.\\n\\nThe Filter allows you to disable any current data point from being forwarded to any current output service. However, as you continue to use mParticle, update your app instrumentation, and add inputs, you will continue to generate new data points. One of the most important decisions to make in the Filter is how to handle new data points for each output service. By default, mParticle will automatically forward new data points to each output service. If you uncheck theSend new data points by defaultbox, no new data points will be forwarded to that output until you explicitly enable it in the Filter.\\nNew data points will be added to the Data Filter the first time mParticle receives them. It should only take a few minutes from mParticle receiving a data point for it to be visible in the Data Filter.\\n\\nA mature mParticle project may have hundreds of events. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of filter switches. To save you time, we provide some convenience methods to help you set your filters quickly.

So to effectively use Audiences, even at the testing stage, your app needs multiple users!\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re not ready to enable the mParticle SDKs in your Production app yet, you can either spin up multiple development environments, or try using theEvents APIto supply some test data in bulk.\\nThe mPTravel app lets users watch video content about travel destinations. This tutorial creates an audience to allow mPTravel to target users who view content about a paticular destination with deals for that destination.\\nThere are three distinct aspects of an event criteria that you can define:\\nAttributes- you can refine your criteria further by setting attribute conditions. This example targets only instances of the Play Video event where the â\\x80\\x9ccategoryâ\\x80\\x9d attribute has a value of â\\x80\\x9cDestination Introâ\\x80\\x9d and the â\\x80\\x9cdestinationâ\\x80\\x9d attribute has a value of â\\x80\\x9cParisâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nNote that this example creates anExact Matchcondition, but there are other types of condition to explore. For example, if you set â\\x80\\x9cdestinationâ\\x80\\x9dContainsâ\\x80\\x9cFranceâ\\x80\\x9d, then you could match events with a â\\x80\\x9cdestinationâ\\x80\\x9d of both â\\x80\\x9cParis, Franceâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cCannes, Franceâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThe types of condition available depend on what kind of data an attribute holds. For example, an attribute that records a number value will haveGreater ThanandLess Thanconditions. mParticle automatically detects what type of data an attribute holds. However, you can manually set the data type by clicking the type symbol.Donâ\\x80\\x99t change the data type unless you really know what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing. If you force the data type to beNumber, and all your attribute values are strings, your condition will always fail! As long as youâ\\x80\\x99re sending the same type of data consistently for each attribute, you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry about it.\\nYou could save this audience right now and target all users who have watched mPTravelâ\\x80\\x99s Paris content in the past three days. But, what if you have some extra special limited deals that you want to save for your premium members? You canâ\\x80\\x99t just tell everyone! You need to add a second criteria. Whenever you have multiple criteria, you need to decide how to evaluate them together. There are three options:\\nTo target users who watched Paris content, AND are premium members, chooseAnd.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='This is a good opportunity to look at theUsercriteria type, as itâ\\x80\\x99s a little different. Where the other criteria match users who have triggered a particular event, theUsercriteria looks at all other information you might know about your users: the type of device they use, where they live, their custom user attributes, etc. This example targets users with a user attribute of â\\x80\\x9cstatusâ\\x80\\x9d, with a value of â\\x80\\x9cPremiumâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nWhen youâ\\x80\\x99ve added as many criteria as you need, clickSave as Draftto come back to your definition later, orActivateto start calculating.\\n\\nWhen you activate the audience, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be asked if you want to set up an A/B Test. SelectNofor now, to go to the Connections Screen.\\nAfter you finish defining your audience you will be taken straight to the Audience Connection screen. Connecting an audience will be covered in the next section.\\nFirst, check that your audience definition is working as expected. Start by selectingAudiencesfrom the left column to go to the main Audiences page. Audiences take time to calculate, so if youâ\\x80\\x99ve only just activated it, youâ\\x80\\x99ll probably see aSizeof 0 for your audience. Mouseover the pie chart to see how far along the calculation process is.\\n\\nAfter a while, as long as you have users that match your criteria, you should start to see the value of theSizecolumn increase.\\n\\nIf the audience is 100% calculated, and your size is still zero, there may be an issue with your conditions.\\nIn some cases, it might be enough just to know that your audience is matching users. However, if you know specific identities of users who should match your criteria, you can check that they matched by downloading your entire audience in CSV form. Follow the instructionshereto download your audience.\\nFor simple audiences, itâ\\x80\\x99s a good idea to check your Live Stream to see if you can find an event that should match your criteria. Here, you can see a user who has triggered the correct event.\\n\\nSome things to check:\\nRemember that recalculating an audience will take some time, so check your criteria thoroughly before you save your changes.\\nCongratulations on making your first audience in mParticle! You will have noticed that mParticle populates your options in the Audience Builder based on the data you have captured. This means that as you add new sources, and send more data, you will unlock new options for building audiences. Check in periodically to make sure that youâ\\x80\\x99re getting the most out of your data. Some mParticle clients create hundreds of audiences, each with dozens of chained criteria to target hyper-specific user segments. Youâ\\x80\\x99re only limited by the data you can capture and your imagination.\\nA few things to read or think about:\\nNext up, you will learn how toconnect an audienceto one of mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s Audience partners.\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/analytics/\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

All new projects default to (GMT+00:00) UTC (00:00). Note, only one time zone may be selected per project.\\nYou are able to set up queries to be in a time zone that is not in your project time zone: The time zone selector is located in the top right corner of the query builder within each tool.\\nThe date format setting determines the display style for dates in Analytics. Dates are commonly found along the x-axis of query results. There are three options for date format: US MM/DD/YYYY, European DD/MM/YYYY, or ISO YYYY-MM-DD. All new projects default to US MM/DD/YYYY.\\n\\nThe currency format setting allows you to change the currency and symbol displayed for all Revenue results in Analytics.\\nTo use the Revenue event, you must complete a Revenue mapping in the Events and Properties settings. All new projects default to US Dollars $.\\nThis setting is applied to Revenue results for reports within your entire Analytics project.\\nIf your currency is not currently supported, please contact support.\\nIf your project is integrated using the Analytics SDK, then the IP Address Collection setting appears in your project settings. You may enable or disable the collection of IP address information for your project. All new projects default to enabled.\\nNote: IP geolocation tracking is restricted under the Child Protection Regulation (COPPA). Please ensure that you have disabled this within any project that contains data from online services directed toward children 13 years of age or younger. Analytics reserves the right to disable IP address collection if we suspect any violation, intentional or otherwise, of this regulation.\\nPermit the sharing of embedded widgets, dashboard links, and scheduled reports externally.\\nEnable or disable AI-assisted features including Assisted Analysis.\\nView and modify all of the teammates in your organization.

There are two basic approaches:\\nThere are compelling business and legal arguments for and against each approach. By choosing the first approach, you have a chance to preserve a complete history of a userâ\\x80\\x99s experience with your app. This might be invaluable for improving your funnel. However, you also introduce the possibility of mingling data from several users into a single profile. For example, on a shared device, multiple users might access the app in a pre-signup state.\\nThe second approach sacrifices the possibility of collecting a userâ\\x80\\x99s entire history under a single continuous view. However, you can be sure that the data from your logged-in users is never mixed up with data from a different user. Quarantining anonymous data from known user data may also be required by law.\\nIDSync is designed to let you make smart decisions about user continuity that fit the needs of your app and to give you transparency into how user profiles are created and updated.\\nUsers often interact with an app ecosystem through more than one device. For example, users might interact with an eCommerce app through both a native app and a web browser, or view media content on a web browser, a native app, or a Roku channel.\\nMany apps will want to track events and lifetime value for a user across all platforms, but others will prefer to keep data for each platform separate. IDSync allows mParticle to support both use cases, and to harness 3rd party data to decisively link data generated from your apps with data from other sources, like CRM Feeds.\\nYour product ecosystem may be spread not just across multiple platforms, but also multiple apps. Needs for tracking users across multiple apps will vary depending on your business model. For example, a gaming organization might publish dozens of individual games and want to track their userâ\\x80\\x99s LTV across all their apps. By creating workspaces for each app group under the same mParticle account, you can allow them to share a pool of users, and create only one profile per known user, no matter how many of your apps they use.\\nAlternatively, you might wish to define different groups of users for different apps within the same ecosystem. For example, you might have one app for vendors and another for buyers, with a completely different set of metrics for each group. IDSync allows mParticle to support either use case.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='Personalization of customer experience (CX) is a top priority for marketers. Personalization reduces friction and increases conversions by presenting relevant in-context content that increases customer awareness, engagement, and satisfaction. The Immutable Identity Setting enables marketers to use the mParticle Profile API to get the most up-to-date real-time user identities, device identities, user attributes, and audience memberships. The Profile API uses either an identifier with Immutable Identity set or the mParticle Identifier to match a user profile. Additionally, IDSync Search allows marketers to query User Profiles by any known identifier, such as email, mobile phone, or device identity, and return all matched user identity values including the mParticle ID. The mParticle ID can then be used with Profile API to get the values necessary to personalize the customer experience.\\nThe ability to provide evidence that demonstrates that your organization is in regulatory compliance is important to every Chief Privacy Officer and corporate information security executive. GDPR and CCPA data privacy controls and traceability are core to mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s user profile data policies. In addition, the IDSync Search capability can verify that a matching User Profile exists. It can also be used after a GDPR or CCPA User Profile Delete Request has been processed, to validate that the process has completed successfully and thereby validate compliance.\\nDifferent user identifiers have different lifespans and degrees of specificity. A Customer ID or a social media ID permanently identify a single user, while an IP Address or Session ID may not be sufficient to identify a single user and can change at any time. Other identifiers fall somewhere in between. Email addresses, for example, do identify a single user, but a user may change their email address over time. IDSync gives you the tools to update identifiers for a User Profile without losing that userâ\\x80\\x99s history.\\nWith mParticle managing all available identities for a user, youâ\\x80\\x99re freed up to focus on your data. One messaging service requires an email address while another needs Push Tokens? Donâ\\x80\\x99t worry about it. Build your messaging audiences in mParticle based on any criteria you need and mParticle will forward the correct identities for each service, as long as they are available.\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",

It is also available as an HTTP API.\\nThe identity API provides four endpoints for identifying users:\\nThese four endpoints are called in response to different user actions, but they all perform the same function - resolving a request containing all known identifying information for the current user into a single, unique mParticle User Profile. That profile might be:\\nIdentity strategies determine which user profile to add data to when the current user can be identified, and what to do when the current user cannot be identified.\\nThere are 5 identity strategies that have been designed to handle different business and privacy requirements.\\nTheprofile conversion strategyis designed to help build a comprehensive picture of a userâ\\x80\\x99s entire journey through a traditional sales funnel.\\nThe main distinguishing feature of this strategy is that when a new login ID is received, IDSync will not create a new profile. Instead, it will simply add the new login ID to the previous profile used to store data collected when the user was anonymous.\\nThedefault identitystrategy is a simplified version of the profile conversion strategy. The main difference is that the unique ID and login ID for the default identity strategy are set tocustomer_id, and they cannot be changed.\\nTheprofile linkstrategy is optimized to track the events that drive users to create an account or make purchases.\\nTheprofile isolationstrategy is built to prevent any anonymous data from being attributed to known users. This strategy is helpful when strict compliance with consumer protection and privacy regulation is required.\\nThebest matchstrategy is not optimized to help uniquely identify users. It is best suited for businesses that do not have a login flow or that provide their primary services without requiring users to log in.\\nEach identity strategy must define the order of precedence for matching user profiles. When an identity request is received, mParticle looks up matching profiles for each identifier in the order defined by the identity priority until a single profile can be returned. Keep in mind that some identity strategies impose minimum requirements that a request must fulfill in order to return a user even if they match (seeLogin Identities). For now, letâ\\x80\\x99s just look at how the identity priority can affect which profile is returned by a request.\\nUser profiles\\nScenarios\\nWhen Choosing your identity priority, ask the following questions about each of the identities you collect:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='User profiles\\nScenarios\\nWhen Choosing your identity priority, ask the following questions about each of the identities you collect:\\nThere are some input feeds that always include a specific user identifier that you may or may not want to include in your identity priority list. To ensure that IDSync requests from one-off feeds like this can still be resolved even if you decided to omit their specific identifiers from your identity priority, you can configure an additional identifier for that specific feed without having to modify your overall identity priority.\\nIf you ingest data from a feed with an extra identifier configured, mParticle still attempts to resolve any IDSync requests using your normal identity priority list first. Then, if no matching profiles are found, mParticle tries any additional identifiers configured for the feed. If a matching profile is still not found, then mParticle handles the anonymous user according to your identity strategy.\\nTo configure additional user identifiers for a feed, contact your mParticle account representative.\\nFor an example of how feed specific identifiers work, imagine the following two user profiles and stored identities:\\nProfile 1\\nProfile 2\\nNow imagine that we have the following identity priority list configured:\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s look at two scenarios where data is ingested from the same input feed with the same identity priority list described above.\\nIn this first scenario, data is ingested from the feed and an IDSync request is made for a user with the only identifier being an AID of9876.\\nSince AID isnâ\\x80\\x99t used in the identity priority and AID isnâ\\x80\\x99t configured as a feed-specific identifier, IDSync fails to resolve the identity and the user is treated anonymously according to the identity strategy even though Profile 1 would be a match for the user.\\nIn the second scenario, AID is configured as a feed-specific identifier. Now, if the same IDSync request is submitted for a user with an AID of9876, IDSync resolves the request to Profile 1. However, this will only be successful if the IDSync request is made for data ingested from the same feed that has AID configured as a specific identifier.\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'),\n",

You decide whether all of your feeds and inputs share the same plan, or if you create a unique plan for every individual client-side and server-side input. Two common scenarios indicate a need for multiple plans:\\nAlthough most of the data planning steps can be completed in the Data Plan UI,Step 3requires a small code change. You must have developer support for the following:\\nOptionally, you can reviewthe JSON Referenceto learn more about the full JSON structure.\\nTo create and implement a data plan:\\nData Plan Builder is a Google Sheet add-on and template that helps you create a data plan:\\n\\nChoose from one of the industry-specific templates or the generic template.\\nOnce you have the JSON from Data Plan Builder, paste it into the Data Plan import window (as explained in Step 1.3 below), or store the file and upload it using theData Planning API.\\nTo create a plan:\\nWhen updating or uploading a data plan by copying and pasting JSON (as when using theData Plan Builder) you must update the version description separately in the mParticle UI.\\nTo start verifying incoming data against your plan, you first need to activate it. To do this, click theActivatebutton on your data planâ\\x80\\x99s home screen. Then in the Activate modal, use the Status dropdown to select the environment in which you want to activate your data plan (devorprod). (You also have the option to save the plan as a draft to return to later.)\\n\\nNow that your plan is active, you need to ensure that incoming data is tagged with your planâ\\x80\\x99s id. Continue to the next step to learn how.\\nBefore mParticle validates incoming data against the plan, the data must be tagged with a plan ID, an environment, and optionally a plan version. This is the step that requires a small code change, as mentioned inPrerequisites.\\nTo find your plan ID, navigate to theplan listing page. In the following image,fintech_templateis the plan ID and should be used in the code snippets below:\\n\\nInclude the plan ID and environment in all batches sent to mParticle.\\nExample Code in Four Languages\\nYou can cut and paste the following example code in either JSON, Swift, Kotlin, or JavaScript for your developer to implement:\\nNow that you have tagged incoming data, use Live Stream to debug violations as they occur.\\n\\nOnce your plan is validating data, violations reports help monitor your data quality. To view violations, clickUnique Violationsin the header row of your data planâ\\x80\\x99s home screen. This will display a violation report like the one below:\\n\\nYour data needs change over time. Data plans can be easily updated to reflect these changes.\\nSmaller changes can be made directly to an existing plan version. Updates to active data plans are live immediately: simply update the plan in the UI and save your changes. For larger changes, we recommend creating a new plan version. Creating a new plan version allows you to track changes over time and to revert back to an older version if necessary.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re using aData Plan Builder, make the update in the builder and follow instructions to export a new data plan version into mParticle.\\n\\nTo view the version history of a data plan:\\nOnce you are confident that your plan reflects the data you want to collect, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. Learn more about blocking data inthe next section.\\nUsing Data Plans, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. You can think of this feature as an allowlist (sometimes called awhitelist) for the data you want to capture with mParticle: any event, event attribute, or user attribute that is not included in the allowlist can be blocked from further processing.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='To prevent blocked data from being lost, you can opt for blocked data to be forwarded to an Output with a Quarantine Connection. To illustrate a typical workflow, assume you choose to configure an Amazon S3 bucket as your Quarantine Output:\\n\\nAnytime a data point is blocked, the Quarantine Connection will forward the original batch and metadata about what was blocked to the configured Amazon S3 bucket. You will then be able to:\\nIn most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle and then forwarded on to an integration partner server-to-server. However, in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all required functionality for an integration, an embedded kit can be used instead.\\nYou can learn which integrations are kits for a given SDK here:\\nBy default, the current Block feature supports blocking for server-side integrations. If you would like to enable blocking for mParticle kits, you need to follow additional steps outlined below for each of our most popular SDKs: Web, Android and iOS.\\nBefore you can enable the blocking feature, you need to create a data plan and initialize the respective SDK with a data plan ID in your code. Read ourâ\\x80\\x9cGetting Startedâ\\x80\\x9d sectionfor detailed guidance.\\nOur SDKs are served by a CDN that caches SDK configuration, including your data plan, for some period of time (the â\\x80\\x9cTTLâ\\x80\\x9d). As a result, updates to a data plan can take time before they are reflected in your client code. To avoid caching a plan version while you are iterating on it:\\nYou can now turn on Block settings for the type of data you would like to block by completing the following steps:\\nFor Web, you can use the developer console to verify when a kitâ\\x80\\x99s underlying SDK uploads an event to the partnerâ\\x80\\x99s API. For iOS and Android, you can typically use verbose console logs or a proxy such as Charles Proxy. Depending on your block settings, you should see unplanned data removed from payloads. For example, if you have not planned â\\x80\\x9cBad Event Aâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cBad Event Aâ\\x80\\x9d will not be forwarded to a specific partner integration.\\nFollow your usual software development process to deploy your code changes to production. Remember to also promote your data plan version to prod through the mParticle UI to start blocking production data that does not match your plan. Plan versions active on production are locked in the UI to prevent accidental updates. The recommended flow for updating a production plan is to clone the latest version and to deploy a new version after testing.\\nTo protect shared resources, every mParticle account includes a memory quota for active data plan versions. The byte size of a plan versionâ\\x80\\x99s JSON representation is a good estimate of its memory footprint. The typical data plan version size is approximately 50 KB.\\nYou can verify your current usage, check the size of a data plan, and if needed, take action to reduce your memory quota usage:\\nContact your mParticle representative if you need more memory provisioned for your account.\\nTo enable validation, you need to point your code to adata plan idwithat least one active version. For a version to be considered active, its status has to be set todevordev & prod.\\nYou can either pin your code to a specific data plan version or omit the version, in which case mParticle will match the data you send with the latest plan version that is active in a given environment (devorprod). Learn more about how to implement a data plan withGetting Started.\\n\\nYou can plan for and validate the following events:\\nThe following events are not yet included:\\nYou can plan for and validate the following user identifier types:\\nTheOtheridentifiers allow you to enter up to ten different custom strings against which to validate data.\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s an example schema configuration for a screen event called â\\x80\\x9cSandbox Page Viewâ\\x80\\x9d:'),\n",

This tool will show you how to implement every data point in your plan for any of our SDKs.\\nSince various mParticle features (Audiences, Calculated Attributes, Forwarding Rules, some integrations) will automatically convert string representations of numbers and booleans to their respective types, data planning does not distinguish between raw numeric or boolean values (e.g.42ortrue) and their string representation (e.g.\"42\"or\"true\").

Our goal is to help you develop a complete view of your users, across all of your data sources, and make that view available wherever it is needed. The user profile is central to this goal.\\nAn mParticle user profile represents a complete picture of what youâ\\x80\\x99ve learned about a given user over time, across all of your channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as you capture new data.\\nWithin mParticle, user profiles serve four core functions:\\nUse profiles in mParticle to understand users and create personalized experiences:\\nInspect the profile for any user in the mParticle UI via the User Activity View. To find user profiles, you can search by any user identity type you capture, or by the mParticle ID. You can also navigate to the User Activity View for active users in your development environment by inspecting a batch in the Live Stream.\\nFor more information, seeUser Activity.\\nProfile enrichment allows mParticle to make sure that each of your downstream systems has the most complete and up-to-date information about each of your users. For example, mParticle receives data as batches from native SDKs, our HTTP API and third-party data feeds. Each batch is a JSON object containing an array of events and contextual information about the user, such as identities, user attributes, and device information. mParticle processes the information in each batch and forwards it to downstream systems through event integrations. Before a batch from a particular source is forwarded, mParticle compares it to the matching user profile and adds additional information.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='If you collect the same user attribute from multiple sources, for example an iOS app and a web app, mParticle accepts the most recent version. For example, if Bob sets his favorite drink to â\\x80\\x9cBeerâ\\x80\\x9d in the web app, and then changes it to â\\x80\\x9cCokeâ\\x80\\x9d in the iOS app the next day, Bobâ\\x80\\x99s user profile will use the most recent value for enrichment.\\nEnrichment ensures that all of your downstream tools can receive complete and accurate information about your users. Remember that you can still usedata filtersto prevent downstream systems from receiving user attributes that they donâ\\x80\\x99t need.\\nThe mParticle user profile can be delivered in JSON format by the Profile API, in order to deliver personalized experiences based on user attributes or audience memberships. To request a profile from the API, supply either the corresponding MPID or a specially configured immutable ID (usually the Customer ID).\\nFor more information, seeProfile API.\\nAudiences allow you to define segments of users based on rule based criteria of their event behavior and profile data. mParticle builds and maintains these segments of users over time which can then be connected to hundreds of outputs for activation.\\nAudiences and Calculated attributes are built from all your profile data, including calculated attributes, and events that have been collected across all your data sources. For real-time audiences, these are within the audience look back window. Standard audiences utilize your extended Data Retention policy. For more information about data retention, seeData Retention.\\nFor more information, seeAudiencesandCalculated Attributes.\\nTwo main classes of data provide context about your users and the events they trigger.\\nUser data\\nUser data describes the attributes of individual user profiles. It includes information such as what identities they have, device types and IDs, and a number of custom attributes such as membership status and demographic information. An attribute can reflect either current or previous values, depending on its nature and how often it is updated. User data is stored in profiles.\\nEvent data\\nEvent data describes actions that your users take. They contain information current for the moment at which the event was triggered. For example, the event â\\x80\\x9cSign upâ\\x80\\x9d could have an event attribute of â\\x80\\x9cmembership tierâ\\x80\\x9d, which denotes the membership status at time of signing up. Event data is stored in events.\\nEach profile describes useful details about the user associated with the profile.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='A user profile contains the following elements:\\nmParticle ID - a unique identifier for the user within mParticle\\nThe most recently seen IP address associated with the user\\nFor each workspace the user has been seen in:\\nFor each device the user has been seen on:\\nMore about the mParticle schema can be foundhere.\\nMost of the time, mParticle automatically keeps user profiles updated as you capture new data with any of the following methods:\\nHowever, sometimes it is necessary to make direct updates to your user profiles in bulk. This happens most often when youâ\\x80\\x99re loading large amounts of data from legacy systems.\\nTo directly update a profile, you can make a standard request to our HTTP API, and leave out theeventsnode. For example:\\nUser attributes updated in this way will not be immediately updated in all downstream event integrations. Most event integrations in mParticle will not process a batch with no events. However, as long as you are sending some event data to each integration, the enrichment process will make sure that user attributes are updated the next time an event is sent for each user.\\nIf it is important for profile updates to be reflected across all your systems immediately, add an event to the batch. For example:\\nFor a given user, attributes are stored at the workspace level, not the device level.\\nUser attributes are ingested according to the following priority:\\nOnce ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonâ\\x80\\x99t be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to set that same key value from a Custom CSV or partner data feed.\\nYou can override the default behavior for input feeds, and specify whether data ingested from a feed creates new profiles or updates existing profiles. Choose from one of three input protection levels:\\nThe default profile protection level for all input feeds isCreate & Update.\\nProfile protection levels are specific to each input configuration, providing more granular control over multiple configurations even if they are contained in a single workspace.\\nWhen ingesting user data from an input, mParticle searches for an existing profile that corresponds with any of the user identifiers included with the data. The identity strategy configured for your account determines if a new profile is created when an existing profile canâ\\x80\\x99t be found.\\nYou can prevent unwanted changes by defining one or more input protections.\\nTo set the protection level for an existing input:\\nWhen creating a new input feed, you are given the input protection dropdown menu, allowing you to set the protection level for that input from the start.\\nThis setting removes all restrictions from an inputâ\\x80\\x99s access to a user profile, meaning that new user profiles can be created and modified as data is ingested.\\nFor example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canâ\\x80\\x99t associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it creates a new profile for the user. If a matching profile was found, the data from the input enriches the found profile.\\nThis setting ensures that only data from known, existing users in the workspace is ingested. If IDSync canâ\\x80\\x99t find a matching profile (in other words, if the user is unknown) then the data is discarded. Only existing users within the workspace can be updated, and all other unknown users are ignored.\\nFor example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canâ\\x80\\x99t associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, mParticle will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID.

These various touch-points are housed under separate brands and any one customer engages with many of them.\\nFurthermore, you have chosen to use a centralized data warehouse to help keep your customer data consolidated.\\nHowever, you want to ingest customer data into mParticle from your warehouse while maintaining a single user profile for each customer. To do this, you must prevent new profiles from being created. This is where theOnly Updateprotection level is useful.\\nBy setting your data warehouse input feed toOnly Update, mParticle ensures that as new data for a known customer is ingested, that data is attributed to a single user profile.

Event batches are ingested normally, but existing profiles canâ\\x80\\x99t be modified and new profiles canâ\\x80\\x99t be added to protect user profiles and IDsync records from undesired modifications from the input.\\nFor example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canâ\\x80\\x99t associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. If a matching profile was found, mParticle will not associate the data with the found profile.\\nIf an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that donâ\\x80\\x99t resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle ingests and forwards the event batch to other outputs, but it will not create a new profile for the MPID.\\nKeeping your customer data clean and uncontaminated is critical. However, itâ\\x80\\x99s also essential to be able to test new connections from your data warehouses to mParticle.\\nTo configure and test a new input feed from a warehouse without allowing any ingested data to modify your existing customer profiles, you can set the initial protection level for the new feed toOnly Read. This allows you to verify that data is ingested properly, without any of that data leading to the modification or creating of new user profiles.\\nAfter youâ\\x80\\x99re confident in your new input configuration, you can change the protection level to allow data from that input to begin enriching profiles.\\nProfiles are available for different periods of time, depending on thedata retention policyfor your account.\\nThe Professional Services team at mParticle provides the following guide for enriching your user profiles with UID2 for more effecive activation through The Trade Desk and others.

You define a calculated attribute in mParticle and, once activated, they are computed automatically over time by using the raw data stream of events and user information. Once youâ\\x80\\x99ve created calculated attributes, you can use them as segmentation criteria in Audiences, Profile API, or connect them downstream to any of your tools. This is incredibly powerful, and can be set up with a few button clicksâ\\x80\\x93no SQL, no pipeline management.\\nYou can define calculated attributes to track almost anything on an individual user, from counting the number of logins in the last 30 days or knowing the last product category viewed, to more complex calculations like the customerâ\\x80\\x99s average order revenue or the most frequent purchase.\\nCalculated attributes provide value in many ways:\\nThe following video explains how calculated attributes help you quickly generate customer insights without needing any developer resources:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='A calculated attribute contains the following elements that you define:\\nCalculated attributes are defined and calculated per workspace; calculations use data available within the same workspace where they are defined. You can create calculated attributes with the same name and functionality in multiple workspaces.\\nAfter you activate a calculated attribute, it initializes using existing data in the mParticle CDP along with any seeded value that was sent usingSeeding API. Depending on the date range selected in the calculated attribute definition, this can take several hours. After initialization, calculated attributes continue to recalculate with new data.\\n\\nCalculations are eithersynchronous(sent with the batch of data being processed) orasynchronous(sent with the next batch):\\nWe currently support 13 calculations organized into four categories:\\nFor a list of calculations and details about each, seeCalculated Attributes Reference.\\nFor an overview of how to use calculation categories, view the following video:\\n\\nCalculated attributes can apply to a date range that you choose:\\nSince: limit calculations to the period of a specified start date to now.\\n\\nNote that above the date range selection drop-downs, the UI displays the date that data was first ingested into mParticle.\\nYou can choose a date earlier than the first date that data was ingested, however, mParticle only calculates as of the earliest ingestion date.\\nAfter selecting an event, you can add conditions to the attribute in order to more precisely define results. For example, a retailer creating a calculated attribute might use the Contains operator with a Count attribute to count only the purchases that contain â\\x80\\x9cSockâ\\x80\\x9d in the product name. For a complete list of operators for the four categories of attributes (Count, Aggregation, Occurrence, and List), seeConditions.\\nSeeding allows you to pass in historic values for calculated attributes that mParticle builds on as new data arrives, without passing in the raw events. Seeding allows you to transition from your own calculations to mParticle calculation. For example, you may have data from outside mParticle about the last four monthsâ\\x80\\x99 bookings. You can create a calculated attribute, then send the seed data to mParticle usingthe Calculated Attributes Seeding API. mParticle then combines your seed data and live data so thereâ\\x80\\x99s no interruption.\\nYou can seed calculated attributes in both draft (recommended) and active states; the calculated attribute must exist before you can seed it.\\nSeeding requires two pieces of information:\\nNote the following calculated attribute behavior:\\nIf a partner supports user attribute forwarding, you can forward calculated attributes in an audience integration alongside user attributes. Different partners have implemented user attribute forwarding in different ways.\\nFor example,Salesforceuses a separate data extension whileGoogle BigQueryuses the configuration setting Send User Attributes.\\nTo walk through several different scenarios for using calculated attributes, download theCalculated Attributes Use Case Guide.\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

Journeys help you to perform journey analysis, testing, and orchestration in a single workflow:\\nBecause customers interact with your brand in many different ways at many different times, you need to reach them based on their behaviors, and reach them with a cohesive voice to deliver a personalized experience across multiple marketing channels.\\nYou want to design a multistep journey: starting with the users available with the inputs you select, you can apply sets of criteria called milestones. At each milestone a new audience is created, which you can then send downstream for further action.\\nYou can create as many journeys as you need (up to your active audience limit), and delete empty journeys when they are no longer useful. You can also delete milestones and their related audiences and connections from a journey and add new milestones.\\nAt the start of the journey, you have access to all the users available from all the inputs from all the workspaces in your account. You choose the workspaces and inputs you wish to select audience members from, and then build the journey:\\nThe following diagram shows a simple journey with two milestones:\\nIn this journey, all customers who engage with the app are sent an email, and those who open the email are sent a mobile push notification.\\nNotice the following:\\nEach step in the customer journey can be split into additional paths. For example, you could define a set of milestones for customers who buy handbags, shoes, or winter coats. Each milestone becomes the start of a new path.\\nYou can also create a milestone for all audience members that havenâ\\x80\\x99t fit any previous milestone criteria. This split is called a remaining user split.\\nThe following three examples show the different ways you can use multiple splits.\\nPowered by Cortex, customer-centric teams can predict a userâ\\x80\\x99s likelihood to churn. Using that prediction, teams can deliver a unique set of experiences for users who have a high likelihood to churn.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='In this example, a brand engages high-churn risk users on multiple channels to ensure they get the message. In addition, the brand sets up a fail safe for the users who received an email but didnâ\\x80\\x99t open it, engaging them over SMS.\\nOne key piece of user preference is their consent status, what theyâ\\x80\\x99ve told the brand about how they want their data to be used for marketing purposes.\\n\\nIn this example, an eCommerce retailer delivers two different kinds of experiences based on a userâ\\x80\\x99s consent to GDPR.\\nIf users have consented, the retailer sends a mobile notification as a reminder to convert. For the remaining users, those who have not consented, the retailer triggers an in-app coupon if the user returns after several days.\\nFor many retailers, a userâ\\x80\\x99s purchase of a product is just the beginning of the relationship between the customer and the brand. After a purchase, the retailer can suggest to the customer many possible next steps to prolong and deepen that relationship: purchasing more products, leaving a review, referring a friend, posting on social media, and more.\\n\\nIn this example, retailers trigger the next best step based on a userâ\\x80\\x99s lifetime value.  For high LTV customers, brands can assume that theyâ\\x80\\x99re fans of the brand, and would be more willing to refer a friend. If the retailer knows a loyal customerâ\\x80\\x99s preferred engagement channel, they can communicates with them there. For the remaining users, those who are not high LTV customers, a retailer can recommend products that pair well with the one that a customer just purchased.\\nEach audience that you create in a journey provides an estimated audience size immediately, so that you donâ\\x80\\x99t have to wait for the audience calculation to complete. Once an audience has at least one active connection, audiences and all parent audiences in same path begin calculating the real size. When an audience begins calculating it no longer shows the estimated size.\\n\\nTo estimate the audience size quickly, mParticle samples the total number of users.\\nYou see the estimated size of the audience with all criteria applied (as shown in the previous image). Estimated audience size per criteria is also displayed on the milestone.\\nUse the audience estimatorâ\\x80\\x99s immediate feedback to adjust criteria definitions and parameters if needed:\\nIn some cases, you may see different symbols instead of an estimated size:\\nWhen an audience is actively connected, that audience is activated and consumes a real-time audience credit. Unlike the real-time audience experience, there is no explicit audience status of Draft or Active. The status is now derived from the connection status.\\nTo view the number of audiences available to you, in mParticle go toAudiences > Journeysto display the list of journeys. The number of activated and available audiences is displayed under the New Journey button:\\nWas this page helpful?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nURL: https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/\\nTitle: No Title'),\n",

By contrast, real-time and standard audiences are static and based on historical data.\\nCreate a predictive audience by specifying a user prediction in your regular audience creation workflow in mParticle. The user prediction accesses Cortex machine learning algorithms that analyze data on customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with your brands. You can use predictive audiences to anticipate the needs and desires of your target audiences, and thus deliver more relevant and personalized messaging. Predictive audiences maximize impact by automatically finding the best-fit users for a desired outcome.\\nIn the past, you created a static (real-time) audience that identifies every user who has viewed shoes two or more times in the last week, and sent a coupon to all those users. However, now you can create a goal-oriented, predictive audience that contains all the users most likely to purchase shoes based on an analysis of all the available information, not just one factor (purchased shoes twice before).\\nWhen you create a predictive audience, you can choose between two types of results:\\nFor example, if you wanted to know how likely it is that a user will purchase shoes in the next 7 days, you could see that likelihood displayed as a score or percentile:\\nCreating a predictive audience is simple:\\nFor step-by-step instructions, seeUsing Predictive Audiences.\\nPredictions are rerun weekly to regenerate fresh predictions.\\nPredictions created in mParticle have the following limitations:\\nCortex is the machine-learning engine available with mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s CDP.

When a consumer/data subject exercises their rights, they create a data subject request (DSR). This page will guide you through mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s support for handling DSRs for both GDPR and CCPA.\\nThis page does not provide legal advice, only a description of how to use mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s compliance-related features. The information provided here is solely for understanding and using mParticle features and is not intended to be legally compliant or specific enough for compliance.\\nThis document uses GDPR language and terminology for simplicity.\\nmParticle providesdata privacy controlsto help you comply with consent and data sale opt-out requirements.\\nThe GDPR defines three entities involved in data collection, with different rights and responsibilities:\\nSimilarly, the CCPA defines:\\nThe GDPR defines some rights of Data Subjects, including:\\nThe CCPA defines that consumers have rights of:\\nmParticle is a collaborator on theOpenDSR framework, which provides a simple format for Data Controllers and Data Processors to collaborate towards compliance with requests from their Data Subjects to honor the above rights. This framework was formerly known as OpenGDPR; it was renamed in early 2020 to include CCPA support.\\nTo find out more about OpenDSR, read the full spec on theGithub page.\\nmParticleâ\\x80\\x99s OpenDSR implementation handles three types of DSRs: â\\x80\\x9cErasureâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cAccessâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cPortabilityâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nEach DSR follows the same basic workflow:\\nThe data controller must log, authenticate and verify the request. If they choose to accept the request, the data controller forwards a request to mParticle in its role as a data processor. The request provides:\\nThis workflow can be managed in mParticle UI or programmatically via theOpenDSR API.\\nmParticle stores data against user profiles, each identified by an mParticle ID (MPID). To respond to DSRs, mParticle first matches identities in the DSR against observed user profiles. This is handled the same way as mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s regular IDSync process: provided identities are resolved to MPIDs to identify affected user data.\\nData subject requests submitted without alogin IDwill not be fulfilled for known profiles that have an associated login ID. For example, if you submit a data subject request that only includes the device ID for a user, mParticle will not be able to find the correct profile to fulfill the request.\\nWhen finding the correct profile for a DSR, mParticle follows the same identity resolution process used for general identification requests made to IDSync (the mParticle identity management system).\\nThe exact profiles returned for a data subject request depend on the specificuser identifierssupplied with the DSR and theidentity strategyconfigured for your account.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='The exact profiles returned for a data subject request depend on the specificuser identifierssupplied with the DSR and theidentity strategyconfigured for your account.\\nAll DSR requests are scoped to a single workspace by API authentication. If you need to apply a DSR to multiple workspaces, please submit it within each workspace.\\nTo get started, enable GDPR and/or CCPA compliance features on your workspace fromWorkspace Settings>Workspace>Regulation. This will allow you to see the DSR UI. mParticle will honor all requests received via API even with these features disabled.\\nYou have the option to include a copy of the live user profile in access/portability requests. Navigate toPrivacy>Privacy Settingsto include a copy of the users profile with GDPR and/or CCPA DSRs. This is for clients whose privacy teams determine that this is required for compliance. The profiles will include: devices, identities, audience memberships, user attributes and calculated attributes. By default, profiles are not included.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\mparticle.txt'}, page_content='The following video explains how to use consent to control data forwarding with mParticle:\\n\\nAs a Data Processor, mParticle will match user profiles for a Data Subject Request based on any identities we are given. As a Data Controller, it is your responsibility to determine how to accept and forward Data Subject Requests in order to best meet your GDPR responsibilities and manage risk. This decision should be managed in conjunction with your Identity Strategy.\\nYou also have the option of using theIdentity APIto identify for yourself the MPIDs you wish to include in the request and submitting them directly, rather than letting mParticle match IDs for you.\\nBe sure to consult your internal privacy and compliance experts when determining your strategy for accepting and forwarding Data Subject Requests.\\nAfter mParticle receives an erasure request, a 7 day waiting period starts. This waiting period gives you the opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is initiated.\\nAfter the 7 day waiting period, any pending erasures are initiated. Once begun, it may take up to 14 days before the erasure is complete. For each completed erasure request, mParticle sends a callback to any specified URLs indicating that the request has been fulfilled.\\nBy default, erasure requests are completed between 7 and 21 days after being received by mParticle. The initial 7 day waiting period provides an opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is carried out.\\nTo skip the initial 7 day waiting period when submitting a data subject erasure request to mParticle, check the option labeledSkip waiting periodin theNew Data Subject Requestmodal.\\nSkipping the waiting period shortens the request cancellation window. This reduces the total time required to complete an erasure request to between 1 and 14 days after it is received by mParticle.\\nIf you wish to remove users from audiences or from event forwarding during the waiting period, set a user attribute and apply audience criteria and/or forwarding rules to exclude them.\\nIn response to a data subject erasure request, mParticle deletes the data it stored, such as historical event batches, audience data, and profiles.\\nA delete request will also not prevent additional data concerning the subject from being received and processed by mParticle. If the data subject wishes to prevent all future data processing, they will likely need to take additional steps, for example, ceasing to use your service/app.\\nAccess and Portability requests are treated exactly the same way, as follows:\\nIf you submit an access and portability request for more than one profile using multiple MPIDs, the data for every profile returned will be included in a single file. Since the resolution process for DSRs is the same as the process for IDSync, an access and portability request that includes only a device ID will not return any profiles that are protected by a login ID.\\nFor example, imagine that a user opens your app and is tracked with an anonymous profile, but they do not create an account with a login ID. Later, a different user on the same device opens your app and logs in with a login ID. If you submit an access and portability request but only supply the device ID, then only the data for the anonymous user will be returned.\\nThe data gathered in response to an access or portability request will be delivered in a.zipfolder containing many.jsonlfiles (JSON Linesformat).  The zip may contain:\\nNote that if no records can be found matching the identities in the request, the request for the zip file returns a404error.\\nA sample portability response can be downloadedhere.\\nIn addition to the OpenDSR API, users with theCompliance or Admin and Compliance rolecan create, delete and monitor DSRs directly in the mParticle Dashboard.\\n\\nTo view details about a request, click the Request ID number.\\nYou can configure mParticle to forward Data Subject Requests (DSRs) for erasure with one or more integrations.'),\n",

Feeds can supplement data collected directly from your app platformsâ\\x80\\x94via mParticleâ\\x80\\x99s SDKs or Events APIâ\\x80\\x94with additional data available only from an external source.\\nData available from feeds may include:\\nWhen planning a feed implementation, it is important to consider if and how you want the data to be forwarded to any event outputs. Event integrations connect an â\\x80\\x98inputâ\\x80\\x99, which is a single platform or feed, to a single â\\x80\\x98outputâ\\x80\\x99.\\nMost outputs can only accept connections from a limited set of platforms. When setting up connections from a feed, you need to know that some feeds can â\\x80\\x9cact-asâ\\x80\\x9d iOS, Android, Web, or other platforms.\\nAct-as feeds are feeds which mParticle can treat as if they belonged to a single platform. For example, if a feed can â\\x80\\x9cact asâ\\x80\\x9d iOS, you can connect the feed to any output that accepts data from the iOS platform.\\nWhen you configure an act-as feed, you will need to select the platform you want the feed to act as:'),\n",

For example, a feed that forwards data about user actions in response to an email campaign will be an unbound feed. These events donâ\\x80\\x99t specifically belong to a platform, like iOS or Android, and wonâ\\x80\\x99t have the necessary identifiers to be processed as iOS or Android events.\\nOutputs that only support iOS / Android / Web will not accept data from unbound feeds.

You must also select a source category and source type that align\\nwith your specific needs and create the source accordingly. For more information about\\nhow to create sources for different categories, refer here.\\nStep 2 - Source Implementation: Once the source is created, proceed with its\\nimplementation. Refer to the step-by-step instructions provided in the Implementation\\nguide tailored to the chosen Source Type. You can download this document from\\nthe IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS tab of the source that you created.\\nStep 3 - Previewing Data: After implementation, you can examine the data that has\\nbeen received into the system under the PREVIEW DATA tab. Note that once the data\\nstarts flowing into the system, the status of the source changes to Integrated.\\nIf no data is ingested, then a message stating “We haven’t received any data yet.\\nplease check again later and ensure that\\nthe source is implemented correctly. In case of any issues,\\ncontact support@zeotap.com” message appears on the screen.\\nStep 4 - Catalogue Mapping: This is the stage in which you can standardise the incoming\\ndata to a single organisational-level catalogue by mapping and applying the required data\\ntransformations. Ensure that your ingested data such\\nas identifiers, traits, consent, events and more are appropriately mapped against the fields\\navailable in the Zeotap catalogue. This ensures the structuring the data flow efficiently.\\nYou can map the ingested fields to the Catalogue fields by clicking MAP TO\\nCATALOGUE under CATALOGUE MAPPING. For more information about the types of\\ndata that you can map and for detailed steps of mapping, refer here.\\nStep 5 - Create Calculated Attributes: This step allows you to derive user-level insights\\nby aggregating your users' isolated actions. You can then use this data to create more\\npowerful customer cohorts. \\nAs a marketer, you can use calculated attributes to create new attributes for a user by\\naggregating their event data over a specific time period. For example, 90_day_revenue of\\na user, 1_week_page_views to check the engagement of a user, units_purchased by a\\nuser for a specific category like T-shirts. \\nThese calculated attributes are used as segmenting criteria and can then be forwarded to\\ndifferent integrations. For example, in a workflow, you can define High Spenders as users\\nwith 90_day_revenue > €500 or Low Engagement Users by\\nputting 1_week_page_views < 5 criteria. For more information about Calculated\\nStep 6 - Create your Audience: Upon successfully creating a source and ingesting your\\ndata into the Zeotap system, the next step involves unifying this data by mapping it to the\\ncorresponding fields on the Catalogue. Subsequently, you can proceed to create a cohort\\nof customers, commonly referred to as Audience as per your use case. This Audience can\\nbe further refined by applying specific criteria.\\nStep 7 - Activation:  Once your Audience is well-defined, you can then activate it on a\\ndesignated Destination.

Message queues decouple the sender and recipient, allowing them to operate independently and at their own pace. Consumers retrieve messages from the queue when they are ready to process them. They can retrieve and process messages independently and at their own pace, allowing for asynchronous processing.The following are the message Queue integration that Zeotap offers:\\nPub/Sub Stream, Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) Stream is a messaging pattern that allows different applications and services to communicate with each other in real-time. In a Pub/Sub system, messages are published to a central exchange (or “topic”) and subscribed to by various recipients. The recipients receive notifications or data as soon as new messages are published, which makes it an efficient and scalable way to exchange information in real-time. For more information about Pub/Sub Stream, refer here.\\nPub/Sub Batch, Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) Batch upload is a way to efficiently and reliably send multiple messages to Pub/Sub topics in a single request. This feature allows you to save network requests and improve the performance and scalability of your applications. In Pub/Sub Batch upload, you create a batch file containing all the messages you want to send. The batch file can be read as often as necessary, but once it is exhausted, only new messages are sent. Pub/Sub Batch upload is useful for processing large numbers of messages at once in real-time applications, as well as in back-end processes that process data over time.

Enrichers are quick functions available for you to perform data transformations. Zeotap enrichers can be broadly classified as Data Transformation Enrichers and Custom Enrichers.\\nMap the Consent Purposes - Once you have mapped all the Identifiers, on the same screen, click + ADD MAPPING. If a source has consent data, then select the incoming consent field and map it to the relevant Zeotap consent field. For more information about mapping the consent purposes, refer here.\\nMap the Marketing Preferences - Capture marketing preferences along with consent to add clarity and assurance to the marketing team while designing the campaign for the right audience. For more information about mapping the Marketing Preferences, refer here.\\nReview Mapping – In the REVIEW MAPPING screen that appears, you can find warnings along with error logs that provide a description of the issue for incorrectly mapped fields. Once you have corrected these fields, the system automatically refreshes, allowing the warning to disappear. For more information about reviewing the mapping, refer here.\\nSave Mapping – When you have reviewed all the fields, click CONFIRM AND SAVE.\\nInformation\\nOnce the mapping is successfully done, then the source transitions to Mapped state.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\zeotap.txt'}, page_content=\"Create Calculated Attributes\\nThis step allows you to derive user-level insights by aggregating your users' isolated actions. You can then use this data to create more powerful customer cohorts. As a marketer, you can use calculated attributes to create new attributes for a user by aggregating their event data over a specific time period. For example, 90_day_revenue of a user, 1_week_page_views to check the engagement of a user, units_purchased by a user for a specific category like T-shirts. These calculated attributes are used as segmenting criteria and can then be forwarded to different integrations. For example, in a workflow, you can define High Spenders as users with 90_day_revenue > €500 or Low Engagement Users by putting 1_week_page_views < 5 criteria. For more information about Calculated Attributes, refer here.\\n\\nCreate Audience\\nThe following are the steps involved in creation of Audiences in Zeotap CDP:\\nCreate Audience: Upon successfully creating a source and ingesting your data into the Zeotap system, the next step involves unifying this data by mapping it to the corresponding fields on the Catalogue. Subsequently, you can proceed to create a cohort of customers, commonly referred to as Audience as per your use case.\\nDefine Criteria for Your Audience: Further, define the criteria for the created Audience to qualify customers (unified profiles). You can leverage the available attribute types to define your Audience and create the optimal marketing strategy for them. The attribute types include attributes such as Events, Profile attributes, Calculated attributes, Consent, Marketing preferences and more. To know more about attributes and how to apply them to your Audience, refer here.\\n\\nActivate Audience on Destinations\\nActivation is the process of linking the cohort of customers to various advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Adform, Twitter and more. This allows you to implement focused marketing strategies that align with the criteria established for the target cohort.\\nAfter defining the audience, you can activate it on a Destination either immediately or you can choose to activate it later. You can revisit this Audience later for further modifications.\\nTo activate the Destination immediately, after defining the criteria for your Audience, on the last screen of the Audience creation, click Activate Now.\\nThis takes you to a new screen, where you can either choose to enable A/B testing on the Audience or activate the created audience by linking it to a specific Destination as shown in the image below.\\nSet A/B Test – This functionality is exclusively available for users who have opted for it. Selecting this option takes you to a screen where you can split the audience into two or more variations. For more information about AB testing and its application, refer here.\\nLink to Destination – This functionality helps you to activate the created Audience by linking to a Destination. For step-by-step instructions on how to activate an Audience, refer here.\\n\\nValidating Data before Onboarding\\nThe following are the best practices for validating data before onboarding:\\nAll sources need to share the sample files to validate the data coming in with the data discovery sheet.\\nAll data should be first uploaded into the sandbox environment and tested, before onboarding onto the Production environment. All clients are given one Sandbox environment. \\n\\nSetting Up Organisation and User\\nThe following are the best practices for setting up Organisations and Users within Zeotap CDP:\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\zeotap.txt'}, page_content=\"Setting Up Organisation and User\\nThe following are the best practices for setting up Organisations and Users within Zeotap CDP:\\n\\nData Residency: All data will reside in the European Union (EU) region unless the customer specifically asks for a different region, which needs to be notified before hand.  \\nIf all the data must be unified, then ensure to onboard them onto the same organisation. \\nIn case of child organisations, data will not be unified across them. This is ideal when:\\nData is kept separate across countries or brands.\\nConsent is specific to a particular brand or source.\\nUser Access Management: Make sure to complete the tree mapping of admin and other roles in the client side.\\n\\nSetting Up Sources\\nThe following are the best practices and recommendations that must be considered when using Sources:\\nFor information on best practices to be followed while setting up different sources, refer here.\\nVerify the sample data provided by the customer for nested or complex structures. Presently, this data type is not supported. If ingestion is necessary, the customer must flatten the data on their end.\\nFor Server to Server aka HTTP API sources, the data formats may need to be transformed. \\nConsider the Events vs Profiles vs other attribute types carefully when defining custom fields based on the customer's use-case and specified data type. For information on Catalogue fields, refer here.\\nFor Deltas, you must only share the updated data to ensure optimal use of processing allowance.\\n\\nSetting Up Predictive Audience\\nThe following are the best practices and recommendations for setting up Predictive Audience:\\nEnsure that data for the relevant events is added and accurately mapped.\\nTo run the RFM and CLV models, ensure that the you have mapped Event Name and Event > Timestamp and Event > eCommerce > Price, Order Value or Cart Value in Zeotap Catalogue Field.\\nThe customer should have access to over 10K events for the specific event on which they intend to initiate model creation. For more information about Predictive Audiences, refer here.\\n\\nSetting Up Journeys\\nThe following are the best practices and recommendations for setting up workflows within Journeys:\\nEnsure accurate mapping of all required data fields under the correct source for creating workflows. Only the mapped fields will be accessible for filtering during workflow creation. \\nAt least one streaming source must be mapped, and it is mandatory for the event_name to be present on the source mapping.\\nMake sure to pre-create the Calculated Attributes needed for the workflows.\\nWhile setting up a Destination, verify that you've entered the correct connection details for the designated channel and are sending all the mandatory fields required for that channel.\\nVerify accurate data mapping between Zeotap CDP and the Channel.\\n\\nSetting Up Consent Orchestration\\nAll the consent and marketing preference attribute should be mapped to relevant consent and marketing preference attributes in the Zeotap catalogue to ensure visibility in Consent Orchestration rules. For more information on Consent Orchestration, refer https://docs.zeotap.com/articles/protect-customer/consent-orchestration-2830401643.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\zeotap.txt'}, page_content='Setting Up Profile API\\nBelow are the best-practices that you need to adhere while setting up Profile API.\\nAs per the Profile API use cases defined in the Discovery Phase, each use case or system must have a separate API key to ensure traceability.\\nYou should invoke the Profile API once per session, only. As the response is unlikely to change, even if the API is called multiple times, you can cache the response locally for subsequent use within the session. However, note that calling the API multiple times is still counted against your usage metrics.\\nTo avoid unnecessary count against your usage metrics,  you can add a check to prevent calling the Profile API when there is no ID to look up.\\nYou can use a separate API token for each interface. This ensures that each interface is uniquely identified and managed separately. Using separate API tokens also enhances the security of your system by limiting access to individual interfaces when one token is compromised.\\nFor user lookups, you can use one of the immutable IDs or primary IDs that you have selected for ID resolution. This ensures that the user is identified uniquely and the lookup is consistent across the different systems.\\nTo ensure security, we do not recommend you implement Profile API on a web interface. Instead, you can implement the API remotely using a service layer. This approach minimises the risk of unauthorised access and other security vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing the API on a web interface.\\nTo call a specific attribute of a user, you can use the Fetch node. This allows you to retrieve only the required attribute instead of calling all user attributes on the client side.')]"
