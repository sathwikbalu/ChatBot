The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, youâll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticleâs features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and youâre looking for in-depth docs, head to ourDevelopersorGuidessections.
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, youâll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
To get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment donât have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for theiOS,AndroidorJavascriptSDKs to get set up before continuing.
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate toSetup > Inputsin the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand theAdvanced Settingsby clicking the + icon.
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their deviceâs advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checkingRestrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Googleâs policies for device advertising IDs:
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request usersâ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Appleâs advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiersin their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit theiOS 14 Guide.
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devicesâ advertising IDs. Similar to Appleâs policy, Google will set a userâs advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Googleâs advertising identifiers intheir documentation.
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
WhenCollect Integration-Specific Identifiersis checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebookâsfbcandfbpfields.
If you donât see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Congratulations, you have created a working data input. Now itâs time tostart capturing some data.

After you create an input, you can begin capturing data.
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticleâs native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you firstset up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app. Of these, the most significant are:
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticleâs native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:
User Attributesare key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. Inthe previous stepyou should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means youâre already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:
Once youâve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.

If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in theprevious step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases arenât showing, itâs likely that there is an issue with your app code.
Excellent, youâve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:
Now that youâre collecting data, itâs time to send it on byconnecting an event output.

To learn more about event outputs before creating your first one, view the following video:

Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Outputs are mParticleâs term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as âintegrationsâ. Outputs come in two types: âeventâ, and âaudienceâ. Audiences are covered in thenext part of this guide. This section will show you how to set up an event output.
mParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create afree Analytics accountto follow along exactly.
Enter the configuration information:
Remember to save your new output configuration.
Now that you have both an input and an output set up, itâs time to connect them:
Once you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in theDebug Console.
If you donât see data arriving in the output service, navigate toData Master > Live Streamand select Message Direction Outbound.
If you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:
If the previous step doesnât resolve the issue:
If there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting to send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:
By now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:
Next up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data bycreating an audience.

Data Master allows you to standardize and validate customer data before it gets shared across systems, applications and teams. It encompasses the following features:

A data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.
Each data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.
For example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:

Here is a view of the a Commerce Event data point in Live Stream:

This view of a data point is from Data Plan:

mParticle allows you to define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users.  This can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios.
You can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.
When you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform.  You can also enrich that data stream with other data sources.  For example, in addition to sending app data, you may want to send in data that is not collected in the app (server side data) and have the mParticle platform match the data based on a user identifier, and then create audiences based upon this superset of data.  Examples of data sent server side might include CRM data, purchase or revenue data from other non-mobile channels.  Make sure all the data that you need is captured is important; audience creation is the first step.
Use audiences to drive user engagement, encourage app downloads, and more.
Letâs say you want to engage with users that have recently installed your app but havenât used your app very much.  Your objective is to drive higher engagement and convert those new users to high lifetime value users.  You want to accomplish this across multiple channels: push notification and email.  Therefore, your audience qualification criteria is that the user has installed your app in the last 72 hours and has less than three sessions.
You can easily and visually define this audience, then configure audience integrations to push notification and email partners - in this example, letâs use Button for push and Mailchimp for email.  Once you configure the respective integrations, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audience in Button and updates the corresponding email marketing list in Mailchimp.  No coding is necessary.
Letâs say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.
Once your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.  From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.
mParticle provides two types of audiences:

Rules allow you to cleanse, enrich and transform your incoming and outgoing data. A rule is a script which accepts an incoming mParticle Events API âbatchâ object and modifies it according to your business logic. Some example use-cases for a rule are:
Each of your Inputs, such as for your web, mobile, or server-to-server data, has an individually configured data pipeline, and each Inputâs pipeline contains the same key stages. Rules are therefore applied for a specific Inputâs pipeline, and itâs up to you choose where in that Inputâs pipeline each Rule is executed. A single Input pipeline may contain multiple Rules each stage.
Stage 1 - Input
Data is received by mParticle for a specific Input (such as Web, iOS, or a custom server feed).
Stage 2 - Storage and Processing
The Inputâs data is stored and processed by mParticle, including:
Stage 3 - Output
The Inputâs data is sent individually to the mParticle Audience system and 300+ partner integrations. In this stage the pipeline actually branches out with a single Input potentially being connected to many Outputs.
Rules are applied to a specific Inputâs pipeline. There are two places in the pipeline where rules can be applied:
In between Stage 1 and Stage 2
Rules executed between Stage 1 and Stage 2 affect the data sent to both Stage 2 and then Stage 3, including the mParticle profile store, audience store, and all outputs. These are labeled âAll Outputâ Rules in your mParticle dashboard.
In between Stage 2 and Stage 3
You can also apply a rule right before itâs sent to aspecificOutput. This lets you mutate data to handle specific requirements or mappings that need to occur for a given partner integration.
Rules are executed on the server and only act on data forwarded downstream server-to-server. A warning is shown in the dashboard if you set up one of the following rules:
mParticle rules are hosted in your AWS account as Lambda functions. To do this, you need to be able to provide an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) for your rule. See theAWS Lambda documentationfor help creating a function.  The Lambda functions used for rules must be hosted in the same AWS region as yourmParticle account.
Your ARNs should look something like this:
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:PROD
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:$LATEST
To connect to your AWS Lambda function, you must provide the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for anIAM user.
In the IAM dashboard, add the following permissions policy for the user:
You will also need to create a role in IAM. Assign this role the same policy document created above.

Assign this role to each Lambda function you plan to deploy as an mParticle rule.


Enter your Development and Production ARNs and clickTest.

When you first test a rule, you must select aFailure Action. This determines what happens if your rule throws an unhandled exception. There is no default action, you must select one of the following:
Regardless of which option you choose, itâs best practice to handle all exceptions in your code, rather than falling back on the above defaults. This is especially true if your rule deals with events, where an unhandled exception from just one event could lead to all events in the batch being dropped.
Your code must be a validLambda function.
The first time you test a rule, you are asked to provide a name, description and failure action. After naming a rule, you can test it by using one of the sample templates provided in the Test rule dialog. You can also copy and paste batch JSON from your Live Stream. If you do this, be sure to pick a full batch to copy, not a single event.  ClickTestto run. Optionally, check a box to save your JSON template in local storage for future testing.
You must enter validbatchJSON in the code editor.
If there are any syntactical errors in your code, warning or error icons will display next to the line number with details of the problem so you can correct.
After clickingTest, you can examine the JSON output from your function to see that the input has been modified as expected.
After a successful test you can clickSaveto save the Rule. Due to recent updates in AWS Lambda, it may be necessary to wait one minute after a successful test in order to save the Rule.
If your test fails, try examining thelogsfor any console output.
When you first create a rule, by default it will only be applied toDEVdata. As well as testing a rule with sample JSON you should test the rule in your dev environment to make sure data reaching your output services is as expected. When you are ready to apply a rule to your production data, clickPromote to Prodon the rule page. This will create a âv1â production rule.
Note that before a rule can be promoted to Prod, you must remove allconsole.log()statements.
If you need to make changes, choose$LATESTfrom theVersiondropdown. All other versions are read only. Test your changes with your dev environment and, when you are ready, clickPromote to Prodto create âv2â of your production rule.
Note that you can have a maximum of 50 versions per rule. If you have too many versions, select a version and click the trash can icon to the right of the version number to delete it.
Each rule has a master switch in the Settings panel. If there is a problem with your rule, you can switch it off and it will be disabled for all connections until you enable it again. To disable, clickEditin the right sidebar and set theStatusslider toinactive.
The following metrics are available:
These metrics are for the last 24 hours and apply to all connections. Summaries for each rule can be seen on the main rules page. Detailed graph of the previous 24 hours is available on theMonitoringtab of the individual rule page.

To help you with troubleshooting rules, mParticle maintains logs for each rule where you can view all console output. From an individual rule page, select theLogstab. You can filter messages by date range or search for keywords.

From the rules listing, select theDeleteaction to delete the rule. If the rule is applied to any connections, it will be removed from those connections.

The Activity section of the mParticle platform allows you to view information about your event data.
The following video provides an overview of the Activity dashboard:

The Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace:

All metrics can be filtered by date range, environment and input.

Displays summary metrics for identity data collected about your users:
This section is filterable by the date range, environment and input options at the top of the page.

Displays summary information representing the current workspaceâs usage, showing the following metrics:
Inputs
Outputs
The User Activity view allows you to see a detailed summary of data associated with a single user. Note that only users with the Admin or Support roles can access the User Activity view.
To find a user, begin entering any known ID for the user, an email address, customer ID, device ID, etc. The ID must match exactly to return a profile. If multiple profiles are returned, select the user you want from the list.
You can search for any element in your Identity Set.
To perform a search do the following:

Enter the search terms in the search field.
View individual results by clicking a row. From the individual results you can do the following:
The information shown on this screen is explained in the following sections.
The following user information will be displayed if available:
List of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whetherLimit Ad Trackingis enabled for the device.
List of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes:
All other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order.
User attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used.
A list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name.
A list of allAudiencesthe user is a member of.
The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user,up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.
Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.

Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.
As with theLive StreamYou can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.

The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.
Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.
To edit a profileâs user attributes:
On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.




On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.



On the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click theEditpencil icon.




To add an identity to a user profile:


The System Alerts dashboard reports all errors returned when forwarding data to your connected outputs. This dashboard helps you to find any connections that are failing to forward data, and it can help you to begin debugging a connection you already know is experiencing problems by highlighting the specific errors reported.
To view system alerts, log into your mParticle account and navigate toActivity > System Alertsin the left nav bar.

The System Alerts dashboard lists all of your connections sorted by their alert volume, from high to low according to alerts reported during the last 12 hours.
You can view alerts reported during different date ranges by using theDatedropdown menu.
To view alerts reported for only the production or development environment, select the environment using theEnvironmentdropdown menu. You can also look for a specific connection with the search bar.
To view details on the specific alerts reported for a connection, select it from the list labeledConnections.

The alerts displayed are sorted by volume and organized according to their type. To view the volume of alerts for each input, click the+icon next to the alert type. You can search for a specific alert using the search bar on the System Alerts dashboard.

The following alert types are supported:

The Event Forwarding report provides information on your appâs incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.
The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.
You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:
Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commerce events, and impression commerce events.
Commerce events behave differently from other events:
In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:

Manage your consent and opt-out privacy obligations under the GDPR and CCPA with Data Privacy Controls. This feature is not prescriptive and there is no single way to implement consent or opt-out. Instead, mParticle gives you a simple, standard technique for storing and applying consent and opt-out choices. Consent state powers both GDPR consent and CCPA data sale opt-out.
This guide introduces you to mParticleâs data privacy control functionality and shows you how to collect an individualâs consent and apply it to your data flows.
Data privacy controls are flexible and customizable, allowing you to build any data flow or consent-based logic you need.
Use mParticleâs data privacy controls to help comply with CCPAâs âdo not sell my dataâ requirement by collecting users who opt-out and blocking those usersâ data from flowing to any âdata saleâ output by:
GDPR defines consent as one method of lawful data processing. One common setup is to:
Once enabled and configured, data privacy work with the mParticle platform to ingest and pass on consent state:

Data privacy controls save user consent decisions and applies them to data flows.


The mParticle format for a single record of a user decision on a privacy prompt,.consent, is ourconsent_stateobject. This is used for both GDPR-style opt-in consent and for CCPA-style opt-out.
For each user or workspace, consent state can be stored for each possible combination of regulation and purpose. For each purpose, the following fields are supported.
All fields are optional, exceptconsented,timestamp_unixtime_ms,regulationandpurpose. Theregulationandpurposefields are built into the structure. Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.
Consent state can be logged via the HTTP API simply by including a consent state object in a batch, mirroring the structure of the user profile (above):
For detailed definitions of how to report consent state, review the sections of our API and SDK references that cover data privacy controls:
Additionally, ourintegration with OneTrustallows you to ingest customer consent states into mParticle.
Consent state is maintained per person on the User Profile using the structure defined above.
For testing consent, you can useUser Activity Viewto check that a consent was recorded correctly. Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:

Consent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a usersâ consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.
For example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:

For GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as âAdvertisingâ:

Consent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.
For example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.
For CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, usersâ who have a consent state oftruefor the CCPA purpose ofdata_sale_opt_outwill NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):
For GDPR, you may want a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:
If you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.
When the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If theconsent_stateobject on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a âsystem notificationâ to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sent to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:
There are currently two ways that consent state changes are forwarded to mParticle event integrations:
Some partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the âsystem_notificationsâ object with each relevant event batch. Forwarding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:
mParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of"Consent", and an event name of"Consent Given"or"Consent Rejected". These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.
Partners that currently accept these custom consent state events include:
âGDPR Consent Changeâ is  listed as a data type in theIntegrations directoryand we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.
mParticle helps you respond todata subject requestsas mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.
You can search for integrations that support data subject requests in theIntegrationspage. Search on categoryData Subject Request.
The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingestGlobal Privacy Control (GPC) signalswith mParticle.
Browsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryable via the DOM. This signal is designed to convey a personâs request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, perthe Global Privacy Control specification. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.
The workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:

This sample code show two options: mapping to a GDPR purpose and mapping to a user attribute.

mParticle is a customer data platform that makes it easy to collect and organize data before sending it to product analytics, A/B testing, marketing automation, and data warehousing tools.
mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle Android SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the Android SDK and a sample ecommerce app calledThe Higgs Shop.
mParticleâs Android SDK supports all Android devices and tablets, including Amazon Fire TV.
By initializing the Android SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your appâs code to send events and user data to mParticle.
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample Android application written in theKotlinprogramming language.

mParticle is a customer data platform that makes it easy to collect and organize data before sending it to product analytics, A/B testing, marketing automation, and data warehouse tools.
mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and product purchases in a mobile app using the mParticle iOS SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle provides thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the iOS SDK and a sample ecommerce app calledThe Higgs Shop.
mParticleâs iOS SDK supports both mobile iOS and tvOS devices.
By initializing the iOS SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your appâs code to send events and user data to mParticle.
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample iOS application written in theSwiftprogramming language.

Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
The Braze Feed allows mParticle to receive Braze interaction data for the iOS, Android and Web platforms. It also supports an âunboundâ feed for events, such as emails, that are not connected to an app platform.
The Braze Feed Integration supports four separate feeds: iOS, Android, Web and Unbound. You will need to create an input for each feed. You can create additional inputs fromSetup > Inputs, on theFeed Configurationstab.

For each feed, select an âAct as Applicationâ platform. For iOS, Android and Web, just select the appropriate option from the list. For your Unbound feed, leave this setting at âSelect Applicationâ.

All events from the Braze Feed will include any available user/device identifiers. Platform feeds will include basic device information.
The Braze Feed sends events for tracking campaign performance. Included as custom attributes for each event are Brazeâs IDs for the relevant Campaign, News Feed Card, Button, Canvas, etc. You can find the IDâs in the relevant sections of the Braze Dashboard underAPI Identifier. SeeBrazeâs Identifier Typesfor more details.
You can also see a full list of your API Identifiers on BrazeâsDeveloper Console.
A full list of events and their allowed attributes can be found inBrazeâs Documentation. For events withcampaign_id,canvas_id,canvas_step_id, andcanvas_variation_idlisted note that an individual event may have acampaign_id, thecanvas_*attributes, or neither.

You can import bulk data, both user attribute and events, from your data warehouse or legacy system using comma separated values (CSV) files. You can use this technique in all regions and with all outputs.
Use the following process to load user attribute or event data from CSV files:
1. Create CSV files
Prepare the CSV files for import. Files must follow the guidelines in this section.
Files must be sent in one of the following formats:
File name requirements:
Column names: specify fields according to ourJSON Schema, using dot notation.
User and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.
Device IDs
User IDs
User attributes:
If you include user attributes, for each, include a column named asuser_attributes.key, wherekeyis a user attribute key. For example:
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in theJSON Referenceare supported.
Events:
Commerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.
Only one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.
Data types:
All data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.
mParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.
Use the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.
To get your SFTP username and password:
Configure the Custom CSV Feed as input. This step provides the hostname and folder path on the SFTP server where your CSV files must be dropped.
To configure the Custom CSV Feed:
VisitSETUP > Inputs > Feedsin the mParticle UI and click theAdd Feed Inputbutton, then select Custom CSV Feed from the list.
If youâve already added the Custom CSV Feed, it wonât show up in the list. Scroll through the list of feeds until you seeCustom CSV Feed, and then click the large plus sign in the gray bar to create a new feed. You need one feed for each different event type.
Enter the following values:
Files on the SFTP location are added to the processing queue nearly immediately.  Depending on file count and file size, a backlog may develop. You can observe how much data has been processed using Data Master and your outbound connections. There is no notification of processing progress or completion.

Mixpanelâsmission is to increase the rate of innovation. Companies use Mixpanel to analyze how & why users engage, convert, and retain in real-time on web, mobile, and IoT devices, and then use the data to improve their products.
If you are new to setting up Mixpanelâs Mobile App Analytics, your best place to start is Mixpanel itself and the below are must-reads before proceeding:
When mParticle sends data to Mixpanel, Mixpanelâs APIs are utilized.  This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.
In order to enable mParticleâs integration with Mixpanel, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic,Find Project Token.
mParticleâs SDK supports nearly all of the Mixpanel SDK specific features natively. When you use the mParticle SDK, mParticle events will be transformed using Mixpanel-compliant naming conventions and activate the corresponding features automatically.
One of the key features of Mixpanel is funnel tracking, this feature requires a consistent approach to identifying your users as they sign up, and progress from being only identifiable by their device, to having a unique âlogged inâ ID.
mParticle manages this process using itsIDSync feature. IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintains a hierarchy of different ID types.
A traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:
If your project has MixpanelâsID Mergefeature enabled, the call toidentifywill connect pre- and post-authentication events when appropriate.
If your project does not have ID Merge enabled,identifywill change the userâs local distinct_id to the unique ID you pass. Events tracked prior to authentication will not be connected to the same user identity. If ID Merge is disabled,  Alias can be used to tie the original Distinct ID (an anonymous device ID) and the new Distinct ID (a unique User ID) together in Mixpanel.
If this process is not followed correctly, funnel tracking wonât be possible, as Mixpanel will see the two Distinct IDs as two completely separate users.
If you wish to use Mixpanelâs funnel tracking features, here is one option for implementing with mParticle:
This option is recommended for new implementations.This option lets your Mixpanel user profiles mirror those maintained by mParticle. This option lets your mParticle Identity strategy take care of aliasing for you, before your data ever reaches Mixpanel.
For this to work, you need to have selected an Identity Strategy that supports funnel tracking, such as theProfile Conversion Strategy. If you use the Profile Conversion Strategy and mParticleâsCustomer IDas your logged-in ID type, a sign-up flow works as follows:
To use this option, set theExternal Identity TypetomParticle IDin theConfiguration Settings.
Note that this example is the minimum necessary to demonstrate the required sign-up flow and does not include additional features, such as completion handlers. Refer to the full Identity documentation:
To support each feature in theSupported Featurestable above, multiple methods will need to be implemented. The following table shows the mapping between each feature and SDK methods.
Tracking standard events in the mParticle SDK is fairly straightforward. Events can be standalone or include event attributes. mParticle attributes are converted to Mixpanel properties automatically when forwarded.
mParticle sends data to different Mixpanel endpoints depending on the age of the events:
Super properties allow certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the user rather than about a specific event, for example, the userâs age, gender, or source. These super properties will be automatically included with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app.
Both Mixpanel and mParticle have the ability to set specific attributes for the user which will persist until overwritten.
If you have enabled the âInclude User Attributesâ setting, then any messages with type ScreenView or AppEvent will include the email user identity (if available) and all user attributes.  TheSetUserAttributemethod can be used to set user attributes. This method will overwrite the values of any existing user attributes.
mParticleâs attribute naming conventions closely resemble standard Mixpanel attributes, which a few exceptions:
These mParticle attributes will just have the leading $ removed:
If these attributes are seen, they will be replaced with Mixpanel attributes:
With available user identity info and user attributes, standard people data being sent includes:
Data being sent in the $set section:
In order to track revenue using mParticle and Mixpanel, you need to ensure that mParticle is forwarding on relevant data by enabling theUse Mixpanel Peoplesetting.  If the mParticle SDK method has been called to log an event, the event and one event attribute have been set up for LTV tracking, and the event is not excluded by an account policy, a transaction message will be sent to Mixpanel.
Only specific data will be considered as part of the transactional funnel. Standard message data format is:
Data being sent in the transactions section:
Event batches sent to Mixpanel using the server-side web integration will also send the following data:
Note that this data depends on thehttp_header_user_agentfield so they will only be set if a value is included in the batch.
By default, mParticle sends data to Mixpanelâs US Servers, but offers an EU Data Localization option for theiringestion API, which allows data to be sent and stored in the Mixpanel EU Data Center (see Mixpanelâs documentation onStoring Your Data in the European Union). This EU Residency is not automatically set within a Mixpanel project. You can find steps on how to set EU Data Localization for your Mixpanel project withinthe Mixpanel documentation. In mParticle, theMixpanel Target Server Configuration Settingmust be set toEU Residency Server.

Amplitudeprovides product analytics that helps companies leverage cross-platform behavioral data to drive user growth.
To activate mParticleâs integration with Amplitude, you need the Amplitude API Key for each app that youâd like to set up.  Your API key is listed on theAmplitude Project Settings page.
The Amplitude integration requires themParticle Amplitude Kitwhen connected to a web input. If you are initializing the web SDK using theSnippet Optionthen the Kit is automatically included for you. If you areSelf Hostingthe SDK then you need to add this kit manually into your source code.
mParticle will forward User Identities and Attributes to Amplitude, even if there are no events in the batch.
Every event in Amplitude has a main Device ID field. mParticle populates this field as follows:
Amplitude also has dedicated fields for particular Device IDs, such as IDFA and Android ID. These will be populated if the ID is available. SeeField Mappings, for more information.
Amplitude requires either a Device ID or a User ID. User ID can be mapped as Email, Customer ID or mParticle ID. If no accepted identifiers are present, data will not be forwarded.
By default, mParticle forwards web data to Amplitude client-side, by directly invoking Amplitudeâs Javascript methods. Optionally, you can choose to forward web data server-to-server in theConnection Settings. Note that if you choose this option, your incoming data must have your selected User ID to be forwarded.
By default, mParticle sends data to the Amplitude organizationâs US endpoint for theHTTP API, but Amplitude offers a different endpoint for EU organizations. In mParticle, theAmplitude Organization Configuration Settingallows you to select a target Amplitude organization location.
mParticle will forward all screen views to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to âViewed ScreenNameâ, whereScreenNameis the screen name passed to thelogScreenSDK method (or the name of the screenâs Activity class if youâre using automatic screen tracking on Android).
mParticle will forward all session start and session end events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set tosession_startandsession_end.
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle is expanded into multiple events before being translated and forwarded to Amplitude. While this expansion applies to all eCommerce transactions, the resulting events are dependent on the type of eCommerce event being forwarded and the number of products in the event.
Note: mParticle will not attempt to forward eCommerce Events to Amplitude which contain no Products.
The eCommerce events resulting from the expansion that may be forwarded to Amplitude are:
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle will result in a transaction level event being sent to Amplitude. This event contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event.
The name given to the Transaction and Item Level Events is determined from theProduct Actionprovided on the eCommerce Event sent to mParticle.
Custom events logged via mParticleâslogEventSDK method and their attributes will be forwarded to Amplitude, with the event name passed tologEventas the Amplitude Event Type. An event namemustbe specified or an error will be returned.
Attribution Custom events will be forwarded to Amplitude prefixed with the attribution provider in the event name.  For example,[AppsFlyer] attribution.  Event Attributes that are included with the event are forwarded to Amplitude in user_properties, also prefixed with the attribution provider.
mParticle will forward all push registration events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set toPush Registration. All Field Mappings defined in this documentation will be forwarded too.
If theSend Application State Transitionssetting is enabled, Application State Transition events will be forwarded to Amplitude as follows:
Only for web requests, mParticle will extract OS and browser info from HTTP user agent.
Similar to Amplitudeâs SDK behavior,os_nameandos_versionwill be populated with browser info. For that reason, mParticle will send 2 additionalCustom User Properties,web_os_nameandweb_os_version, that will contain OS info. SeeAmplitudeâs doc.
mParticle will also populatedevice_brandanddevice_modelfrom the HTTP user agent if theExtract Device Family from User Agentsetting is enabled. With this setting enabled, if mParticle cannot determine the device brand or model, it will populatedevice_brandwith the same value as is set forweb_os_name. Note, the device values may differ slightly between S2S events and events sent through the Amplitude web kit.

This section describes the configuration settings necessary to activate mParticleâs event tracking integration with Facebook.  The event tracking integration enables conversion tracking for Facebook advertising campaigns.
Facebook has limits around the number of unique event names and attributes their platform can process as noted here:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/android/current/class/AppEventsLogger/
Event data from mParticle to Facebook is typically sent server side.  However, Web data can be sent client or server side based on your implementation and settings.  These different options require different settings:
You need to perform a few steps in Facebook to create aFacebook Pixel S2Sconnection.
Facebook recommends sending the same pixel event twice - once from the browser and once from the server. If done incorrectly, this can result in duplicate events appearing in Facebook. The following steps walk through how to configure this within mParticle.
To do this using mParticle, you will need to perform the following steps:
Ideally, all Web data sent to mParticle will be sent through the mParticle Web SDK, but it is still possible to deduplicate events outside of this flow if necessary. To ensure redundant events sent through Facebook Pixel and the Facebook Conversions API are correctly deduplicated when they reach Facebook, two conditions must be met:
If you use the mParticle Web SDK and server-side web integration, then this will be automatically handled.
If you need to manually assign asource_message_idvia the web SDK and server-side separately, use the following API:
You can also assign asource_message_idto commerce events:
Note that your workspace will need to be on event batching in order to leverage passing a customsource_message_idto the Web SDK for this to work.  If you are not on web batching, please contact your customer success manager.
Visit theFacebook Business Help CenterandFacebook For Developersfor more information on the subject of deduplication.
Please run through the following steps to confirm your settings are correct:
If you run into issues with either of the above steps, please repeat the steps described inConfiguring Facebook Pixel Server-to-Server.
The Facebookadvertiser_tracking_enabledfield is set based on theatt_authorization_statusandlimit_ad_trackingfields as defined below.  Check theiOS14 Implementation guidefor more information.
Ifatt_authorization_statusis available:
Ifatt_authorization_statusis not available, thelimit_ad_trackingfield is evaluated:
mParticle will send a variety of user data fields to Facebook for advanced matching. The specific fields sent depends on if Facebook Pixel server-side forwarding is enabled or not.
Facebook Pixel Server-Side Forwarding Disabled
mParticle will hash and send the following fields to Facebook when they are set for a user.
Facebook Pixel Server-Side Forwarding Enabled
mParticleâs Facebook integration supportscustom mappingswhich allows you to map your events and attributes for Facebook. mParticle provides mappings for the following Facebook event types:
When setting up the custom mappings, the fb_content_type can provide additional information on the event to be used forCollaborative Ads.  The acceptable values for fb_content_type are:
If a value provided for fb_content_type is not in the above list, the value sent will beproduct.
mParticle forwards the mParticle product events Added to Cart and Added to Wishlist to Facebook using Facebookâs corresponding pre-defined event names.  mParticle Product Views are forwarded to Facebook as the pre-defined event âViewed Contentâ.  The unit price, currency, product category, and SKU are passed to Facebook as well.  See below for a sample Added to Cart event call using the Facebook SDK, and an equivalent call using the mParticle SDK.
Purchase events logged through mParticleâs eCommerce SDK methods will be forwarded to Facebook using Facebookâs âPurchasedâ pre-defined event name.
All custom app events, which are logged via mParticleâslogEventSDK method, will be forwarded to Facebook as custom app events, using the event name passed to mParticleâslogEventSDK method.
For theWebplatform, mParticle will forward screen views as âPageViewâ events.
For theiOS/tvOSandAndroidplatforms, screen views are supported by custom mappings. Reference thecustom mappingssection for more.
There are several fields only accepted by server-to-server Web connections. These fields and the mParticle fields they are set from are listed below:
*Custom data fields can also be set via custom mappings or E-Commerce event fields. See the relevant sections for more details.

You can opt in to V5 of the Braze SDK by selecting the version in a connection setting in the mParticle UI.
For more details about upgrading to V5 of the Braze web SDK,follow these instructions, whether you self-host or load mParticle via snippet/CDN..
If you are using version 2 of the @mparticle/web-appboy-kit, you will need totransition to @mparticle/web-braze-kit per the instructions herebefore following the above instructions as well.
Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
Braze offers a broad range of functionality via their solution and it is critically important that you work directly with your Braze representative to ensure that you are correctly planning and implementing their features.  mParticle does not recommend enabling forwarding to Braze until you have completed the Braze planning process with your Braze team.
ThemParticle SDKallows you to include the Braze kit which allows Braze interface components (images, layout files, etc.) and as a result supports many Braze features, including:
Features are supported by the mParticle SDK only after you install themParticle Braze Kit(formerly Appboy), which then forwards data from your app to Braze.
Features are supported in two ways:
The mParticle S2S APIallows you to send data server side (API reference). The S2S API supports iOS, Android and Web data. In this scenario, mParticle forwards data via Brazeâs REST API which supports a limited set of features.
For server-side data to be forwarded to Braze, it must include your selected External Identity Type. To relax this requirement, see the Disable External ID Constraint connection setting.
The following event types can be forwarded to Braze via S2S:
The Braze solution offers features that involve Braze-proprietary user interaction components including Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback.
To use Braze with one of the mParticle mobile SDKs, please review the kit documentation for theAndroid SDKor theiOS SDK.
You must directly call the Braze kit to use the Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback features. Examples of directly calling a kit are provided for bothAndroidandiOS.
To comply with Appleâs iOS 17 privacy manifest it is required to update to Braze SDK version 9.0.0 or later which is included by the mParticle Braze Kit version 8.60 or later. Note that it is also required to update to at least version 8.24.0 of the mParticle SDK if you are not creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mParticle Braze Kit in order for this functionality to work.
There are also additional steps required to comply which are outlined in the Braze documentationhere.
If you are creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mParticle Kit as described in the iOS App Launch Tracking sectionbelow, you can simply follow instructions in the above Braze documentation directly.
If not, you will still need to follow the above Braze documentation, with the following exceptions:
Push notifications work differently for web and for mobile.
mParticle integrates with Braze to allow web push notifications to further engage your visitors. We integrated BrazeâsSoft Push Prompts, which allows you to ask your user if theyâd like to stay in touch before the browser alerts them to allow notifications. This is done since the browser throttles how often you can prompt the user for push notifications, and if the user denies permission, you can never ask them again. See below for directions on how to implement push notifications, which customizes Brazeâsimplementation instructionsto work with mParticle.
Configure your site
mParticle hosts Brazeâs service worker in order to prevent unpredictable versioning issues. Do not use Brazeâs service-worker.js CDN.
Configure Safari Push
Create a âPrime for Pushâ in-app messaging Campaign on the Braze dashboard. Note that this is anIn-App MessagingCampaign, and not aPush Notificationmessaging campaign.
Optionally, you can change the name and location ofservice-worker.js. The following example will clarify the steps:
As long as the Braze Kit is included in your app, mParticle will pass any Push Notifications from Braze to the kit for display. However, you will need to provide credentials in the Braze dashboard.
See the mainiOSandAndroidPush Notification documentation for more detail.
On iOS, when a user launches your app by tapping on a push notification, you may see these launches recorded in the mParticle dashboard but not in Braze. This happens due to a race condition between the Braze SDK initializing and the app handling the push notification.
To work around this, youâll need to create your own instance of Braze in yourapplicationDidFinishLaunchingmethod of your app delegate and pass it to the Braze kit before initializing the mParticle SDK. Youâll also need to tell the kit not to process push notifications and instead handle them yourself. This ensures that Braze is initialized and ready to receive the push notifications immediately upon app launch.
Note that by implementing your own instance of Braze, you will lose the ability to use the following Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard, as youâll be passing those options to Braze yourself on app launch. Only implement this if you need push notification app launches reported to Braze:
All other Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard will continue to work as usual, and any of the above can be set in your app when you create the Braze instance by setting the relevant options on the Braze configuration object. See the example code for thedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsmethod below.
The following is mostly following the instructions fromBrazeâs âManual push integrationâdocumentation, with the addition of some mParticle specific code in thedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsmethod.
Please note that because we are following BrazeâsâManual push integrationâinstructions, you should not set the configuration option,configuration.push.automation = true, as described in BrazeâsAutomatic push integrationdocumentation as it will cause conflicts.
The Braze kits foriOSandAndroidsupport Brazeâs automatic location tracking features, provided that the appropriate app-level permissions are granted by the user.
For Android push notifications you will need to provide your Server Key in your app settings page underPush Notification Settings.

For iOS push notifications you will need to upload your APNs Push SSL certificate to Braze. See theBraze documentationfor more.
mParticle supports the ability to conduct A/B testing with different integrations by sending a sample of users and their data to one integration and a different sample of users and their data to a different integration.  If you are using the mParticle SDK for Braze deploymentandcalling Braze methods directly, when instrumenting with the mParticle SDKyou must ensure that the Braze kit is active in the App before calling a Braze method.  This is very important and ensures that you are not inadvertently calling Braze methods for apps/users that are not part of an Braze A/B sample.
mParticle supports the ability to forward server-side events for the Roku platform. Note that only data that includes your selected External Identity Type can be forwarded to Braze.
mParticle will always forward events if sent via the mParticle SDK, provided you have included the Braze kit, but will only forward events sent via the mParticle S2S API if the following conditions apply:
Braze maintains several instances.   As part of theConfiguration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.  You can tell yourBraze Instancefrom the URL of your Braze Dashboard.
Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Usinghttps://or a trailing/in your endpoint address will cause errors.
In order to activate the Braze integration, you will need your Braze App Identifier API key and your âApp Group REST API Keyâ if using the S2S API.

Depending on the setting value forBundle Commerce Event Data(seeConnection Settingsfor more), Commerce Events may be expanded based on the number of products, promotions, or impressions, respectively. Ex:
A purchase event is mapped and optionally-expanded to Braze purchase event(s) as described above.
In addition to theCommon Commerce Fields, the following information is also captured, if defined:
All other product-based commerce event types are mapped and optionally-expanded to Braze custom event(s) as described above. Note:
As such, all relevant product and transaction information is conveyed via thepropertiesfield.
In addition to theCommon Commerce Fields, the following information is also captured, if defined:
All product-based commerce events, regardless of type, capture these common fields in thepropertiesdictionary in the following way:
Note: For web kit data, in order to forward theTransactionId, you must include thetransactionAttributesas the fifth argument below. See ourAPI docsfor how to build transaction attributes.
Whenpromotionsare expanded, eachpromotionis converted to its own outgoing Braze event.
Alternatively, if expansion isnât toggled,promotionsare included in a nested collection in a single outgoing Braze event.
Whenimpressionsare expanded, eachproductfrom eachimpressionis converted to its own outgoing Braze event.
Alternatively, if expansion isnât toggled,impressionsand their associatedproductsare included in a nested collection in a single outgoing Braze event.
Your screen view events will be passed to Braze using the screen name that you passed to ourlogScreenSDK method, as the event name.
If you are using automatic screen tracking in our Android SDK, the automatically-generated screen view events will be forwarded to Braze using the name of the associated Activity class.
To send session start and end events for S2S to Braze, enable theForward Session Eventsconnection setting. After enabling this setting, session start and end events are forwarded to Braze as custom events with the namesSession StartandSession End. When available, session IDs are also sent in thesession_idproperty on all session starts and ends, screen view, and custom events.
However, note that mParticle SDK kits do not support session events, which are never forwarded with a kit, whether or notForward Session Eventsis enabled.
All custom events will be forwarded to Braze using the event name that you passed to yourlogEventSDK method.  All event attributes will be forwarded to Braze as Braze custom event properties using the attribute names you passed to yourlogEventSDK method as well.
Note: Braze documentation indicates that the following reserved keywords canât be used as custom event properties:
To learn more, visit the Braze documentation:
The table below describes how the mParticle integration maps user attributes to Brazeâs profile attributes.
Braze advises tocoerce data typeson user attributes shared with Braze before sending Production volume data. This ensures that the custom attributes received by Braze are of the expected data type. This can impact segment building and triggering campaigns.  If incorrect data types are identified after data has been flowing, there can be extra work to true up the users with the legacy data type on those attributes.  To give Brazeâs type detection a better opportunity to evaluate data types properly, you can enable the following 2 Connection Settings:Enable API Custom Attribute Type DetectionandEnable Kit Custom Attribute Type Detection.
By default, mParticle forwards all available user attributes and user identities to Braze, including attributes added during profile enrichment. You can disable this behavior in theConnection Settings.   Only data which is sent to Braze Server to Server can be enriched.
A User Attribute can be mapped to a Braze Subscription Group ID. Requests sent to mParticle containing the mapped User Attribute, with a validtrueorfalsevalue, will determine if the user in the request should be subscribed (true) or unsubscribed (false) from the group. This allows for dynamic subscription management based on user attributes.
To configure Subscription Group Mapping:
Map the desired User Attribute to the Subscription Group ID in the mParticle dashboard.
Send the mapped User Attribute on your event batch to mParticle with a boolean value.
A misconfigured Subscription Group mapping can affect how your data is forwarded to Braze. If you notice your Subscription Groups are not being updated, check the following:
Please note that Braze will only return an error in these cases when the Subscription Group attribute update is theonlyitem in the request sent to Braze. If the request contains valid events and/or purchases, Braze will process these and skip the Subscription Group update. This also means that you will only see Subscription Group errors in theSystem Alertspage when the invalid Subscription Group update is theonlyitem in the request.
Braze uses the$google_ad_user_dataand$google_ad_personalizationcustom attribute keys to receive consent status for Googleâs EU User Consent Policy. The Boolean sent to these keys signify that a user has granted or denied consent to a marketer. As per theirCollecting consent for EEA, UK, and Switzerland end usersdocumentation, this value must be sent to Google as a Custom Attribute.
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticleâs notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticleâs platform, see the following docs:Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the Consent Mapping connection setting.
Braze occasionally makes breaking changes to their SDK, so if you call Braze directly in your code, you will have to update your code to ensure your website performs as expected when updating versions of Braze.
We recommend you use version 5 of the Braze SDK.  You only need to make code changes if you directly call the Braze SDK from your code. Otherwise, you can simply selectVersion 5from the mParticle connection settings.
If you are upgrading from V3, you should check the breaking changes from theBraze V4 Changelogas well asBraze V5 Changelog, in addition to theV4/5 migration guideto learn about the breaking changes.  The most significant breaking changes are the replacement of theappboyclass name withbrazefrom V3 to V4, in addition to the removal and renaming of several APIs.  If you are updating from V4 to V5, there are fewer changes, but youâd follow the same defensive code recommendations below.
You can opt into the latest major version of the Braze Web SDK whether you implement mParticleâs Web SDK using npm or our snippet/CDN.
Note that the following is only one example, and demonstrates an upgrade from V3 to V5.  Everywhere you manually callappboy(or other deprecated API) needs to be updated similar to the below. If you are using NPM, you can skip to step 4.  Please be sure to test your site fully in development prior to releasing.
Step 2: Roll out code changes to be used before you opt in to using Version 4 of the Braze Web SDK so that it works under both versions:
Step 3: Whether you are using the snippet or self-hosting, you need to navigate to your Braze connection settings and selectVersion 5from theBraze Web SDK Versiondrop down.
Step 4: After you opt in, you can simplify your code. We recommend testing and waiting at least 24 hours between opting in and removing previous instances ofappboyand doing thorough testing of your application in a development environment to ensure everything is working:
Step 4: Push Notifications via service-worker.js
If you use Push Notifications, we have updated theservice-worker.jsfile.  In our testing, Brazeâs push notifications work as expected regardless of what version of the service-worker is used, but we recommend updating this file to ensure future compatibility.  In yourservice-worker.jsfile, update the code to referencehttps://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-5.5.0.jsinstead ofhttps://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-3.5.0.js.  Yourservice-worker.jsfile should now contain:
The legacy @mparticle/web-appboy-kit from NPM includes version 2 of the Braze Web SDK.  As part of this update, weâve created a newBraze web kit repoto replace our deprecatedAppboy web kit repo.  If you are still using@mparticle/web-appboy-kit, you will need to consider the breaking changes Braze made between V2 and V3 of the Braze SDK (foundhere) as well as the instructions above to get from V2 to V5 of the Braze SDK.

AppsFlyeris a leading Mobile Attribution & Marketing Analytics platform that allows app marketers to easily measure the performance of all their marketing channels - paid, organic and social - from a single real-time dashboard.
mParticleâs integration with AppsFlyer includes a required Kit integration and an optional server-side integration. The Kit forwards event data from your app to AppsFlyer on the client side, and also handles app install attribution, uninstall tracking, and deeplinking, including deferred deeplinking. Supplementary data from outside your app can be forwarded to mParticle via our Events API and sent on to AppsFlyer server-to-server.
Google has several notions of user-provided consent.  Two of these apply to AppsFlyer events:ad_user_dataandad_personalization. These represent consent forad user dataandad personalization.
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticleâs notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticleâs platform, see the following docs:Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the User Consent Data Mapping connection setting.
In the absence of a user-defined consent value for thead_user_dataandad_personalizationfields via the Consent Purpose mapping, a default value can be optionally configured via a separate drop-down setting for each consent type. When no user consent is provided, the default status is used, if specified.
Caution: It is recommended that in the long term, you set up user-specified consent through the Consent Purpose mapping, such that the user consent is correctly forwarded to Google. It is your responsibility as a Data Controller to stay compliant under the GDPR, and set up user consent collection for downstream forwarding. The consent default setting can be deprecated in the future.
mParticleâs AppsFlyer integration requires that you add the AppsFlyer Kit to your iOS or Android app. Just by adding the binary to your app:
mParticle publishes the AppsFlyer Kit as separate iOS and Android libraries which have a transitive dependency on the mParticle core libraries. You can add them to your app via Carthage, Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager, or Gradle:
Refer to theApple SDKandAndroid SDKguides to read more about kits.
AppsFlyerâs SDK requires the forwarding of the Google Play Install Referrer Intent. The AppsFlyer kit will take care of this for you as long as youâve added mParticleâsReferrerReceiverto you manifest, or you are manually forwarding the Intent to ourReferrerReceiverclass. The mParticle SDK will then forward the Install Referrer intent to each configured kit, including AppsFlyer.
Please see theAndroid SDK setup guideto ensure your manifest is configured properly.
The AppsFlyer SDK exposes client-side deep linking and attribution APIs, all of which are supported by the mParticle AppsFlyer kit and are covered in this section. The core use-cases are:
Each platform has very specific requirements to ensure that the above functionality is supported. The minimum requirements are:
mParticleâs SDKs will automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK, forwarding the requiredUIApplicationlifecycle events and thecontinueUserAcivityevents for iOS and Android, as well as registering a delegate such that you can retrieve deep linking and attribution parameters on the client-side to customize your userâs in-app experience.
Specifically, the AppsFlyer SDK exposes one distinct callback:
mParticleâs API includes a wrapper for this callback, and both the iOS and Android kits expose a constant to inform you when the callback has been fired and if it was successful. On both platforms, the iOS/Android kit will register a delegate/callback with the AppsFlyer SDK on initialization and for the lifetime of the appâs process, and will call your completion handler block (iOS) orAttributionListener(Android) whenever there is new conversion data available.
When a user clicks a OneLink link, the AppsFlyer SDK retrieves available OneLink data from the AppsFlyer servers. Then, the UDL API calls thedidResolveDeepLink()method which returns aDeepLinkResultobject containing a status and (if successful) aDeepLinkobject containing thedeep_link_valueanddeep_link_sub1-10parameters you can use to customize the resulting in-app outcome.
However, when users deep link directly using universal or app links, thedidResolveDeepLinkmethod returns the full link unparsed since the app opens directly without going through AppsFlyer first. You can read more about AppsFlyerâs deep linking methodshere.
The parameters returned in these results will match the result of the AppsFlyer SDK, as documented forAndroidandiOS.
See the deep linking documentation foriOSandAndroidfor more information.
The following core test scenarios that should be verified:
The AppsFlyer Kit will forward app events and eCommerce events to AppsFlyer.Custom Mappingsare available to map your custom app events ontoAppsFlyerâs event names. Refer to the iOS and Android SDK docs for details on instrumenting your app for event tracking:
eCommerce
App Events
Note that AppsFlyer enforces alimit of 45 charactersfor event names.
The source code for each kit, as well as sample apps, are available on Github:
mParticle can forward app events and commerce events received via ourEvents APItoAppsFlyerâs server-API. Note that AppsFlyer requires data to be linked to a unique AppsFlyer ID, generated client-side by the AppsFlyer Kit. mParticle stores the AppsFlyer ID in its internal user profile. This means that:
For iOS 14, mParticle will send theattfield based on theatt_authorization_statusto AppsFlyer in their expectedformat. Check theiOS14 Implementation guidefor more information.

The mParticle Facebook Audiences integration allows you to forward mParticle audience data directly to a Facebook Ads Manager account for use with Facebook Custom Audiences, making it easy to target existing or prospective customers.
You must have Full Access to the Facebook Ads account you want to forward your audience data to. To check if you have Full Access:


The Facebook Ads account you are connecting to must have accepted the following terms of service:
To see if youâve accepted the terms of service:

If you want to forward usersâ Facebook IDs with your audience data, you must have the Facebook Application ID number for your app or integration. To find your Facebook Application ID, you need to access the Facebook Developer Dashboard. To find your Facebook App ID:

Once you have satisfied the prerequisites described above, follow the steps below to set up the mParticle Facebook audience integration.
Setting up and using the audience integration for Facebook includes three stages:







Check the box next to each of the following user identities you want to forward to Facebook with your audience:
Email addresses and Facebook IDs result in higher match rates with Facebook users because they are more unique across the Facebook platform, so itâs recommended to use these identities whenever they are available.

CheckEnable Multi-Key Audienceto have an additional audience forwarded to Facebook that includes all of the user identities you selected in the previous step.
CheckMatch on User Attributesto have mParticle forward all available attributes from the following list for each user. This can increase the match rate for your audience. All user attributes are hashed asSHA256before being forwarded to Facebook.
To create a value-based lookalike audience, checkIs Value Based Audience, and use the User Attribute Representing Value dropdown menu to select an mParticle user attribute to forward to Facebook.
UnderCustomer File Source, select one of the following as the source of your audience data:
Select the identity you want to forward to Facebook as an external email address from theExternal Email Identity Typedropdown.
Select the identity you want to be hashed and forwarded to Facebook for use as an external unique ID from theMulti-Key External ID Typedropdown.
To find your new custom audience(s):


mParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.
Following are the user identities and device identities that can be forwarded to Facebook. Identities that are hashed asSHA256are noted.
The âmatch rateâ for a Facebook audience refers to the percentage of your forwarded user data that Facebook successfully matches to active Facebook users.
When you connect an mParticle audience with Facebook, several user identifiers are included for each audience member (such as email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertiser IDs). After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.
There are several factors that can impact your match rate:
A higher match rate means that more of your user data was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, itâs important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.
You can use the mParticle audiences integration to create value-based lookalike audiences. These audiences target users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with your existing high-value customers.
However, unlike traditional lookalike audiences, which are based solely on demographic or interest similarities, value-based lookalike audiences are generated using an attribute that reflects the monetary value or profitability of your customers. For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.
By default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if the value of their âvalue reprepresenting attributeâ is greater than 0. You can include values equaling zero by checkingAllow Zero Valueswhen creating your value-based audience.
You can learn more about value-based lookalike audiences inFacebookâs documentation.
As of July 2, 2018, Facebook requires that all new audiences disclose whether their data was collected from customers directly, collected from partners, or both. You can provide this information in the connection settings when connecting an audience to Facebook via the Customer File Source setting.
You can learn more about the Customer File Source Requirement inFacebookâs documentation.
Facebook does not allow more than500 custom audiencesto be created per Facebook Ads account. If you attempt to forward more than 500 audiences to Facebook, an error will be returned.
The Facebook Audience integration uses bulk forwarding. This means that instead of forwarding audience data in real time, mParticle adds updates to a queue. By default, mParticle forwards data to Facebook from this queue whenever one of the following conditions is met:
Before activating your new connection, or when troubleshooting issues, please be aware of the following:
During steps 4-5 of the first stage of the setup process, you connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Make sure that you use a Facebook account that has been granted access to the Facebook Ads account you will forward your audiences to, and make sure that after connecting your Facebook account that you use theFacebook Account IDdropdown menu to select the Facebook Ads account.
It is possible to have access to multiple Ads accounts, so make sure that you selected the correct Ads account when creating your output.
ReadAccess to a Facebook Ads accountfor instructions on how to make sure your Facebook account has the correct access. If you do not have the correct access, reach out to your Facebook Ads account administrator.
If you are trying to forward Facebook IDs from mParticle to Facebook, you must provide your Facebook application ID.
Often referred to as an app ID, a Facebook Application ID is a unique ID assigned to your application when you register it on the Facebook Developers platform. This App ID is required to integrate your application with various Facebook functions, such as logging in through Facebook, accessing Facebookâs Graph API, or incorporating social plugins like the Like button.
SeeAccess to your Facebook Application IDfor instructions on how to find your application ID.
While you may see your forwarded mParticle audiences listed in Facebook Ads right away, it can take up to 24 hours before your audience data begins to fully populate. This time can vary depending on how large your audiences are.
After logging into Facebook Ads Manager, make sure that you select the correct Business Portfolio from the left-hand navbar. You should select the Business Portfolio containing the Ads Account you chose to forward your audiences to.
When you select more than one user identity to forward to Facebook, a separate audience will be created in Facebook for each identity you select. If you want to have a single audience containing all of the identities you selected, make sure that you checkEnable Multi-Key Audienceswhen connecting your audience to Facebook.
However, even with multi-key audiences enabled, you will still see an additional audience in Facebook for each identity selected.

Snap is a camera company whose flagship application Snapchat, the Spectacles product, and a variety of publisher tools provide brands a unique platform to reach targeted audience segments with engaging and personalized content.
In order to enable the mParticle integration with Snapchat you will need the account credentials for a Snapchat account.  The integration activation process will prompt you to log into your Snapchat account, and once logged in, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audience data to Snapchat. If you intend to use the optional Value Based Audience feature, you will need to request Snap to enable the feature for your ad account and ensure they complete such request before you create a Value Based Audience connection in mParticle.


When forwarding audience data to Snapchat, mParticle will send SHA-256 hash of the following identities based on the values of the Connection Settings:
The Snapchat Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Snapchat whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
When you delete a connection or audience, the downstream segment in Snap will be deleted.
You can use the mParticle audience integration to create value-based audiences with Snap. As a prerequisite, Snap must enable value-based audience support for your ad account.
By default, mParticle will forward all users in a value-based audience to Snap even if their user attribute representing value is missing or negative. You can exclude users with negative, missing, and zero values by unchecking theAllow Zero And Negative Valuesconnection setting when creating your value-based audience.

mParticleâs Twitter Tailored Audience integration enables app owners to push audiences created in Audience Manager to Twitter. Once the integration is activated and your audience is pushed to Twitter, you can then target Promoted Tweets to your Tailored Audiences for engagement, cross-promotion, exclusion targeting or monetization use cases.
In order to enable audience forwarding to Twitter, you will need the account credentials for a Twitter account that is linked to your appâs Twitter Ads account.  The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Twitter account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Twitter. The account you login with will need a permission level of Account Administrator to connect an affiliated Ad Account.
Depending on the Configuration Settings that you select (see below), Twitter will use one or more of the following IDs to match users:
mParticle sends these IDs as a SHA-256 hash.
mParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.
For more information about advertising through Twitter, seeTwitter Business.

Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
mParticle audiences correspond to BrazeâsSegmentsfeature and can be used to target engagement campaigns in Braze.
In order to activate our Braze integration, youâre going to need theAPI keyfor each app that youâd like to set up, which can be found by logging into your Braze account and navigating to your appâs settings. You will also need to create anApp Group REST API Keyin the Developer Console.
Braze maintains several instances. As part of theConfiguration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.  You can tell yourBraze Instancefrom the URL of your Braze Dashboard.
Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Usinghttps://or a trailing/in your endpoint address will cause errors.
mParticle will attempt to match users in Braze based on IDFAs, Android Device IDs, and a customizableExternal User ID field, which uniquely identifies a user in Braze. You can set which Identity Type to use as the External User ID in theConfiguration Settings. Your External User ID should be a unique, permanent identifier â usually Customer ID or Email. If you are also using theEventintegration, make sure you set the same External User ID across both integrations.
The Braze API does not allow mParticle to directly create and maintain membership of segments in Braze, so the Audience integration works by setting attributes on a user, which you can then use todefine a corresponding segment in Braze. Like mParticle, Braze populates itâs Segment Manager based on the actual data points received, so you need to create audiences in mParticle and connect them to Braze first. Then, provided your audience is not empty, the segment membership attributes should become available in the Braze Segment Manager within a few minutes.
mParticle offers seven ways to set segment membership attributes, controlled by theSend Segments AsConfiguration Setting. The drop-down has the following options:
These options will be explained in further detail below.
Note that Audience IDs can be found in the main Audience list view.

For example, note the Audience IDs for these three audiences:
This is the default behavior.  mParticle creates a single custom attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembership. The value of this attribute is a comma-separated string of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipwith a value of"'13053','13052', '13051'"in Braze.
See theSample Braze Profilefor an example.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze using the mParticle Audience ID,
with the filterSegmentMembershipâmatches regexâ13051. Itâs important to choose thematches regexoption, and notequals, or users with membership in more than one audience will not be matched.

mParticle creates a single custom array attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembershipArray. The value of this attribute is an array of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipArraywith a value of["13053","13052", "13051"]in Braze. Note, however, that Braze parses array attributes to make them more readable.
See theSample Braze Profilefor an example.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filterSegmentMembershipArrayâincludes valueâ13051

mParticle creates a custom attribute in Braze for each audience that a user belongs to, based on the External Name of the audience.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member of audienceTest Audience 1will show the attributeIn Test Audience 1istruein Braze.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filterIn Test Audience 1âequalsâtrue.

mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle Array AttributeandSingle String Attribute.
mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle Array AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle String AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
mParticle will send attributes as described bySingle Array Attribute,Single String AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
Here is a sample Braze profile with all options enabled.
Since mParticle does not directly maintain segments in Braze, it will not delete segments when the corresponding mParticle audience connection is deleted or deactivated. When this happens, mParticle willnotupdate the audience user attributes in Braze to remove the audience from each user.
Deleting an audience does not remove the custom attributes in Braze.

Pinterest - Reach people who are using Pinterest to discover and plan the things they want to do in the future.  Using the Ads API, businesses on Pinterest manage, scale and optimize their Promoted Pins.
In order to enable mParticleâs integration with Pinterest, you need to have abusiness accountwith Pinterest, and the account credentials for the Pinterest account.  The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Pinterest account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Pinterest.
If you are not working with a Pinterest Marketing Developer Partner, contactadvertiser-data-onboarders@pinterest.comand CC your Pinterest account team requesting access to the Pinterest API.
When forwarding audience data to Pinterest, mParticle will send SHA-1 hash of IDFAs, Google Advertising IDs and Emails based on the values of the Connection Settings.
The Pinterest Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Pinterest whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
mParticle doesnât delete the downstream audience when you delete an audience in mParticle.

The mParticle platform is the hub for all of your data. It collects data from any number of inputs - mobile apps, web, feeds from external SAAS providers, data sent via our Events API - and forwards it on to output services to be used for analytics, attribution, storage, audience targeting, push notifications, etc.
The primary task accomplished in the mParticle dashboard is creating Connections between inputs and outputs - to collect your data, enrich and transform it, and forward it to where it needs to go. mParticle forwards two main types of data:
mParticle creates a unique organization for you. Itâs the container for all data and metadata related to your mParticle. Within an organization, mParticle will create one or more accounts for you, and within each account, you can create one or more workspaces. Your choices for account and workspace setup are important because these choices affect identity and feature provisioning.

These three nested containers provide scoping and functionality for multi-brand and multi-geo use cases, as well as edge use cases. The scope and advantages of each are explained in the following sections.
Organization
Most mParticle customers have one organization which contains one or more accounts. However, some large companies have multiple organizations. No information is shared across organization boundaries. mParticle creates the organization(s) for you.
A few features apply at the organization level, includingprofile strategies.
You can think of the organization as representing your company.
Account
Each organization has one or more accounts. Accounts often represent different functional groups or goals within an organization, for example regional divisions, or Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. mParticle creates the account(s) for you.
Some information is shared across accounts either by default or by enablement:
Workspace
Each account contains one or more workspaces. A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account.  mParticle creates your first workspace, but you can add more at any time.
For most use cases, each workspace is its own domain, separate from other workspaces. Some information is shared across workspace boundaries:
Some mParticle accounts have over a dozen workspaces, while others have only one. How you organize data from your app ecosystem is entirely up to you.
Use organizations, accounts, and workspaces to manage multiple brands, regions, and to manage custom identity configurations and unique input/output requirements.  You can also use mParticle features likecross-account audience sharingormultiple workspace real-time audiences.
To see which accounts and organizations are available:
The Best Bags company sells handbags under several different names, and in several regions of the globe. They can use organizations and workspaces to provide differentiation when needed:
You can also useidentity scopeto manage how user data is shared between workspaces and accounts. And if you need to share audiences across accounts, you can request that mParticle enablecross-account audience sharingfor your organization.
Click on the name of your current workspace in the top-left corner of the dashboard to open the workspaces menu. From here you can switch into any of your current workspaces, or clickSettingsto open the Workspace Settings page.

From the Workspace Settings page, you can:
Note that you canât delete a workspace that is part of aMulti Workspace Audience. First delete or modify the multiworkspace audience, then you can delete the workspace.
mParticle handles Web data â collected from a browser client â a little differently from data collected from native apps.
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle, and then forwarded on to integration partners server-to-server.
There are exceptions to this rule: in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all the required functionality of an integration partner, an Embedded Kit may be used. Embedded Kits are extra components added to the mParticle SDK that communicate directly with an integration partner from the app client.
While direct communication between the client and partner is the exception for native apps, it is common for web data. A key reason for this is that most of mParticleâs integration partners are not set up to receive web data server-to-server, as they rely on cookie data only accessible to the cookie owner. To support these integrations, the mParticle Web SDK uses the following workflow:
To make it easier to work with web integrations, we provide the source code in a public repository, so you can work with the Integration Partnerâs documentation and see exactly how we map mParticle methods onto the Partner code. See themparticle-integrations organizationfor a complete list of client-side web integrations.
mParticle imposes limits on the number and length of attributes that can be associated with events and users.
A quick summary of some of the most important limits is below. For more information, see our fullDefault Service Limitsguide.
Events
Users
Note that Output Services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticleâs. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your Output Services in theIntegration Centerto make sure you are complying with their limits.
Browsers add third-party tracking protection for end users. The protections affect third-party trackers and their cookies and work in different ways. For example, Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) relies on a list of known trackers to decide what to block. Safari, Chrome for iOS and other browsers with the Apple WebKit engine use Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). ITP prevents the browser from loading cookies from a third-party domain.
mParticle aligns with this privacy stance.
mParticle ingests data points that are composed of event attributes and user attributes.
For a given user, attributes are stord at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Once ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonât be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonât be able to set that same value from a partner data feed.
When mParticle ingests data, there are two timestamps associated with events:
If batches or events have a timestamp that is more than 15 minutes in the future, relative to the server processing the data, that timestamp will be reset to the current server UTC time. Attribute timestamps remain unchanged.
If you load data using CSV Import, the batch timestamp is reset to the current server UTC time.
mParticle strives to be as transparent as possible. Part of this transparency is to share information about products, features, or functionality that we expect to deliver in the future.
Forward-looking statements are as accurate as possible given the knowledge at the time of publication. However, no purchasing decisions should be made on the basis of any forward-looking statement, and mParticle may withdraw or change the products, features, or functionality mentioned in such statements.
To get started with mParticle, set up some data inputs and integrate with at least one output service. SeeWeb End-to-End Tutorialfor instructions on how to set up connections, and see your first data flow from input to output. If you arenât working with Web apps or services, visitGetting Startedfor more generic instructions.
Once youâre up and running, see the rest of this Platform guide for a more advanced look at the mParticle dashboard, or browseIntegrationsto see all available integrations.

mParticle provides multiple data flows to ensure different kinds of data travel from a client application or the web (input) to a destination (output).
Data about an event, including individual attributes, may be forwarded from the input to an output in a variety of ways:

Some integrations allow you to choose either server-side or client-side when you configure a connection.
No matter which data flow your integration uses, a connection is required. A connection is the combination of an input, an output, and the configuration information required to make the connection work. Most of the configuration information is specified in the mParticle UI, but some values may need to be fetched from the output, and you may need to add a kit to an SDK for some client-side integrations.
The Connections screen controls how event data from your inputs (iOS, Android, Web, Feeds, etc) is forwarded to your output platforms. You must set up a separate connection for each input-output-configuration combination. For each connection, you have several opportunities to cleanse and filter your data, to ensure that each output receives the data you want it to receive, in the correct format.

Each output has its own requirements, so the process for setting up each connection is a little different. However, all connections require these basic steps:
Data flows once an input and output are connected and the connection is active. For an overview before you create your first connection, view the following video:

1. Select an input
2. Apply âAll Outputsâ transformations
Once you have an input selected, you can set up transformations that are applied to all outputs connected to that input. ClickAll Outputsto see options.
There are two transformations that can be applied here:
3. Select an Output
Once you have selected an input, you will see a list of available outputs that can receive data from your selected input. If this list is empty, go toSetup > Outputsto create some outputs.
The following video shows how to create an output:

The mParticle UI may indicate that you need or may need to add a reference to a kit in your platform dependency configuration. You can do this after you create the connection but before you change theConnection Statusto active. SeeAdd a Kitfor more information.
4. Complete Connection Settings
Complete any settings that apply to the connection. These will be different for every output but can include:
The minimum platform version of your input that the connection will forward data from.
If you set theMin Platform Versionconnection setting, then mParticle will only forward data from inputs with anapplication_versionthat is equal to or greater than the version you set. This allows you to create a separate connection for different versions of your app.
5. Apply âSpecific Outputâ transformations
The second set of transformations apply only to your selected Output. ClickSpecific Outputto see options. Specific output transformations include:
When you configured your output in step 3, the mParticle UI may have indicated that you do need or may need a kit added to the SDK for your app or web pages:
If so, check the integration documentation for your output. If a kit is required, follow the instructions for adding the kit to your input platform dependency configuration.
After you have completed the required settings, set up any transformations, and added a kit (if needed), you are ready to activate the connection:
Very large data volumes may take up to 48 hours to process. To reduce processing time, reduce the number of sessions your account sends to fewer than 200,000 per day.
Verify that data is flowing. Check in the mParticle UI and in your downstream app or system (output).
OpenData Master > Live Streamand select the following values:

If you donât see events being forwarded,troubleshoot your connection.
To verify that data is arriving n the downstream system:
If you donât see events being forwarded,troubleshoot your connection.
Follow these steps to troubleshoot an event connection:
Still not sure whatâs wrong? ContactmParticle Support.
SeeRulesfor more information on all-output rules.
mParticle lets you customize the data that you send to each output. There are many reasons to do this, including:
Unlike other transformations, the data filter exists on its own page, separate from the Connections screen. A data filter allows you to decide which events/attributes you want to send to each output. By default, all event attributes are enabled when you first activate a connection. From the event filter you can:
SeeThe Data Filterfor more information.
Like the event filter, forwarding rules let you filter out events from being sent to an Output. But where the event filter is based on event and attribute names, forwarding rules look at values, which lets you build some more complex conditions. There are several types of forwarding rules.
User Sampling is applied to a single output and sends only a subset, or sample of your data to an output. The main reason to do this is to control costs on services that charge by volume of data. Data is sampled on a user level, not an event level - if you select a 50% sample, mParticle forwards all data received from half of your users, not half of each userâs data.

SeeRulesfor more information about specific-output rules.
Some services allow your incoming events to be translated into events specific to the service. For example, if you have a custom event named âNextLevelâ, typically this event would be forwarded as a custom event to a service. With custom mappings, you can specify that this event be forwarded to a service using their specific event name. For example:
For partners that support custom mappings, the outputâs events are listed on the left side of theCustom Mappingstab. For each event, you can then select an mParticle event and associated attributes to map to the partnerâs event.

The following integrations support custom mappings:
If an event has a Custom Mapping for a particular connection, it will be displayed with an icon in the Event Filter

If you turn off forwarding of an event with a Custom Mapping, the mapping information will be deleted.
The final and most crucial transformation step is the mParticle Forwarder Module itself.
After all your other transformations have been completed, the forwarder module turns your data into messages to the output in its preferred format.
Each integration has its own forwarding module. Settings for the forwarder are derived from three places:
Based on these settings, mParticle transforms your data into a format accepted by the output. This can involve extensively reformatting the data. For example, Mixpanelâs API accepts events, with attributes given as a flat set of key-value pairs. To fit this structure, a single mParticle eCommerce event with four products will be transformed into four Mixpanel Events - one for each product - with common attributes, such as user and device info, repeated for each event.
The documentation for each integration will tell you what you need to know about how data is transformed to be accepted by the Output service.
mParticle provides many opportunities to transform and enrich your data. It is often possible to perform the same transformation in more than one place. For example, if you wanted to drop all Application State Transition events for a given output, you could use the event filter, or you could write a condition in an output rule. There are advantages to each choice. The event filter can be used by anyone with the appropriate access to your organization in the mParticle Dashboard, so it is easy to update and maintain. Writing a rule gives you much finer control over your data, but rules may be difficult for non-developers to understand or alter.
Make the necessary transformations to your data in as few steps as possible. The fewer times you alter your data, the easier your integration will be to troubleshoot and maintain.

A key benefit of mParticle is the ability to collect your data only once, no matter how many places you need to use it. However, you probably donât wantallof your data going to every output service you use. For this reason, mParticle provides the Data Filter as a simple way to control the flow of data to your outputs.
The Data Filter displays a complete list of all data points (a data point can be an event, an attribute of a user or event, or a user identifier) collected in your workspace, and allows you to disable forwarding of any individual data point to any of your output services.
The following video explains data filtering in mParticle:


The first time you visit the Data Filter, you will see an empty grid. To start filtering you need to:
You can filter event data at 3 levels: Event Type, Event Name and Event Attributes.

It's important to remember that the Data Point Filter is independent from the mParticle forwarders that handle transforming and forwarding your data to each output service. It includes switches for every data point, even if that data point is never forwarded to a particular output service. For example, Amplitude only accepts Customer ID and Email Address as User IDs. Leaving the filter switches on for other ID types will have no effect.
Always check the documentation for each integration for details on what data is forwarded.

The Filter allows you to disable any current data point from being forwarded to any current output service. However, as you continue to use mParticle, update your app instrumentation, and add inputs, you will continue to generate new data points. One of the most important decisions to make in the Filter is how to handle new data points for each output service. By default, mParticle will automatically forward new data points to each output service. If you uncheck theSend new data points by defaultbox, no new data points will be forwarded to that output until you explicitly enable it in the Filter.
New data points will be added to the Data Filter the first time mParticle receives them. It should only take a few minutes from mParticle receiving a data point for it to be visible in the Data Filter.

A mature mParticle project may have hundreds of events. Thatâs a lot of filter switches. To save you time, we provide some convenience methods to help you set your filters quickly. To access the shortcuts for an output service, click the elipsis near the top of the column.

Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Up until this point, youâve been testing your account with a single development build of your app. This works well to establish basic data throughput.
The Audiences feature allows you to target segments of your users based on their activity or attributes. So to effectively use Audiences, even at the testing stage, your app needs multiple users!
If youâre not ready to enable the mParticle SDKs in your Production app yet, you can either spin up multiple development environments, or try using theEvents APIto supply some test data in bulk.
The mPTravel app lets users watch video content about travel destinations. This tutorial creates an audience to allow mPTravel to target users who view content about a paticular destination with deals for that destination.
There are three distinct aspects of an event criteria that you can define:
Attributes- you can refine your criteria further by setting attribute conditions. This example targets only instances of the Play Video event where the âcategoryâ attribute has a value of âDestination Introâ and the âdestinationâ attribute has a value of âParisâ.
Note that this example creates anExact Matchcondition, but there are other types of condition to explore. For example, if you set âdestinationâContainsâFranceâ, then you could match events with a âdestinationâ of both âParis, Franceâ and âCannes, Franceâ.
The types of condition available depend on what kind of data an attribute holds. For example, an attribute that records a number value will haveGreater ThanandLess Thanconditions. mParticle automatically detects what type of data an attribute holds. However, you can manually set the data type by clicking the type symbol.Donât change the data type unless you really know what youâre doing. If you force the data type to beNumber, and all your attribute values are strings, your condition will always fail! As long as youâre sending the same type of data consistently for each attribute, you shouldnât have to worry about it.
You could save this audience right now and target all users who have watched mPTravelâs Paris content in the past three days. But, what if you have some extra special limited deals that you want to save for your premium members? You canât just tell everyone! You need to add a second criteria. Whenever you have multiple criteria, you need to decide how to evaluate them together. There are three options:
To target users who watched Paris content, AND are premium members, chooseAnd.

This is a good opportunity to look at theUsercriteria type, as itâs a little different. Where the other criteria match users who have triggered a particular event, theUsercriteria looks at all other information you might know about your users: the type of device they use, where they live, their custom user attributes, etc. This example targets users with a user attribute of âstatusâ, with a value of âPremiumâ.
When youâve added as many criteria as you need, clickSave as Draftto come back to your definition later, orActivateto start calculating.

When you activate the audience, youâll be asked if you want to set up an A/B Test. SelectNofor now, to go to the Connections Screen.
After you finish defining your audience you will be taken straight to the Audience Connection screen. Connecting an audience will be covered in the next section.
First, check that your audience definition is working as expected. Start by selectingAudiencesfrom the left column to go to the main Audiences page. Audiences take time to calculate, so if youâve only just activated it, youâll probably see aSizeof 0 for your audience. Mouseover the pie chart to see how far along the calculation process is.

After a while, as long as you have users that match your criteria, you should start to see the value of theSizecolumn increase.

If the audience is 100% calculated, and your size is still zero, there may be an issue with your conditions.
In some cases, it might be enough just to know that your audience is matching users. However, if you know specific identities of users who should match your criteria, you can check that they matched by downloading your entire audience in CSV form. Follow the instructionshereto download your audience.
For simple audiences, itâs a good idea to check your Live Stream to see if you can find an event that should match your criteria. Here, you can see a user who has triggered the correct event.

Some things to check:
Remember that recalculating an audience will take some time, so check your criteria thoroughly before you save your changes.
Congratulations on making your first audience in mParticle! You will have noticed that mParticle populates your options in the Audience Builder based on the data you have captured. This means that as you add new sources, and send more data, you will unlock new options for building audiences. Check in periodically to make sure that youâre getting the most out of your data. Some mParticle clients create hundreds of audiences, each with dozens of chained criteria to target hyper-specific user segments. Youâre only limited by the data you can capture and your imagination.
A few things to read or think about:
Next up, you will learn how toconnect an audienceto one of mParticleâs Audience partners.

When you create a new project, donât forget to review and configure your custom project settings. Project settings include time zone, date format, currency format, IP address collection, integrations, and project filters. Settings apply to all teammates, data, and saved analyses within the project.
Owners and Admins have access to Project Settings, however Members and View Only teammates do not. Select the cog wheel icon on the left menu bar to review Project Settings.

Within Project Settings youâll be able to access General Settings, Teammates, Data Sources, Scheduled Reports, and Data Filters.

The time zone setting determines the display time zone for all events within the project. All new projects default to (GMT+00:00) UTC (00:00). Note, only one time zone may be selected per project.
You are able to set up queries to be in a time zone that is not in your project time zone: The time zone selector is located in the top right corner of the query builder within each tool.
The date format setting determines the display style for dates in Analytics. Dates are commonly found along the x-axis of query results. There are three options for date format: US MM/DD/YYYY, European DD/MM/YYYY, or ISO YYYY-MM-DD. All new projects default to US MM/DD/YYYY.

The currency format setting allows you to change the currency and symbol displayed for all Revenue results in Analytics.
To use the Revenue event, you must complete a Revenue mapping in the Events and Properties settings. All new projects default to US Dollars $.
This setting is applied to Revenue results for reports within your entire Analytics project.
If your currency is not currently supported, please contact support.
If your project is integrated using the Analytics SDK, then the IP Address Collection setting appears in your project settings. You may enable or disable the collection of IP address information for your project. All new projects default to enabled.
Note: IP geolocation tracking is restricted under the Child Protection Regulation (COPPA). Please ensure that you have disabled this within any project that contains data from online services directed toward children 13 years of age or younger. Analytics reserves the right to disable IP address collection if we suspect any violation, intentional or otherwise, of this regulation.
Permit the sharing of embedded widgets, dashboard links, and scheduled reports externally.
Enable or disable AI-assisted features including Assisted Analysis.
View and modify all of the teammates in your organization. Users are listed with their name, role, status, and last login date.

Project Owners and Admins may change project member roles by clicking on the downward arrow within the role tab.


The Data Sources section displays a summary of the active and inactive data sources for your project, including the name, type, and date that event data was last seen (or received). A green dot indicates that the project received data from this data source recently. A red dot indicates that the project has not received data from this data source recently. A gray dot indicates that there is no information available about the status of this integration.
You are able to add a new data source to the project by clicking on New Data Source on the top right. This brings you to the Connect Your Data screen.

You may also view all data sources within an organization by accessing Data Sources within Organization settings. This will display data sources across all projects.

Data warehouse users may also view the specifics of their data warehouse integration by selecting Edit Details.

Project Settings also contains a tool to manage Scheduled Reports. The table shows when reports were created and by which user, and the three-dot menu on the right allows editing of the underlying dashboard, as well as the features of the report itself. See ourReportsdocumentation for more details.


If your project contains any data filters, then the data filters section displays the defining criteria for the filter(s). Data filters are applied to all queries within a project; they do not modify or otherwise change the underlying data in Analytics.

mParticleâs IDSync features are designed to address the following common issues with user management.
A common scenario for a media or ecommerce app goes something like this:
How should the data from this interaction be organized? There are two basic approaches:
There are compelling business and legal arguments for and against each approach. By choosing the first approach, you have a chance to preserve a complete history of a userâs experience with your app. This might be invaluable for improving your funnel. However, you also introduce the possibility of mingling data from several users into a single profile. For example, on a shared device, multiple users might access the app in a pre-signup state.
The second approach sacrifices the possibility of collecting a userâs entire history under a single continuous view. However, you can be sure that the data from your logged-in users is never mixed up with data from a different user. Quarantining anonymous data from known user data may also be required by law.
IDSync is designed to let you make smart decisions about user continuity that fit the needs of your app and to give you transparency into how user profiles are created and updated.
Users often interact with an app ecosystem through more than one device. For example, users might interact with an eCommerce app through both a native app and a web browser, or view media content on a web browser, a native app, or a Roku channel.
Many apps will want to track events and lifetime value for a user across all platforms, but others will prefer to keep data for each platform separate. IDSync allows mParticle to support both use cases, and to harness 3rd party data to decisively link data generated from your apps with data from other sources, like CRM Feeds.
Your product ecosystem may be spread not just across multiple platforms, but also multiple apps. Needs for tracking users across multiple apps will vary depending on your business model. For example, a gaming organization might publish dozens of individual games and want to track their userâs LTV across all their apps. By creating workspaces for each app group under the same mParticle account, you can allow them to share a pool of users, and create only one profile per known user, no matter how many of your apps they use.
Alternatively, you might wish to define different groups of users for different apps within the same ecosystem. For example, you might have one app for vendors and another for buyers, with a completely different set of metrics for each group. IDSync allows mParticle to support either use case.
Personalization of customer experience (CX) is a top priority for marketers. Personalization reduces friction and increases conversions by presenting relevant in-context content that increases customer awareness, engagement, and satisfaction. The Immutable Identity Setting enables marketers to use the mParticle Profile API to get the most up-to-date real-time user identities, device identities, user attributes, and audience memberships. The Profile API uses either an identifier with Immutable Identity set or the mParticle Identifier to match a user profile. Additionally, IDSync Search allows marketers to query User Profiles by any known identifier, such as email, mobile phone, or device identity, and return all matched user identity values including the mParticle ID. The mParticle ID can then be used with Profile API to get the values necessary to personalize the customer experience.
The ability to provide evidence that demonstrates that your organization is in regulatory compliance is important to every Chief Privacy Officer and corporate information security executive. GDPR and CCPA data privacy controls and traceability are core to mParticleâs user profile data policies. In addition, the IDSync Search capability can verify that a matching User Profile exists. It can also be used after a GDPR or CCPA User Profile Delete Request has been processed, to validate that the process has completed successfully and thereby validate compliance.
Different user identifiers have different lifespans and degrees of specificity. A Customer ID or a social media ID permanently identify a single user, while an IP Address or Session ID may not be sufficient to identify a single user and can change at any time. Other identifiers fall somewhere in between. Email addresses, for example, do identify a single user, but a user may change their email address over time. IDSync gives you the tools to update identifiers for a User Profile without losing that userâs history.
With mParticle managing all available identities for a user, youâre freed up to focus on your data. One messaging service requires an email address while another needs Push Tokens? Donât worry about it. Build your messaging audiences in mParticle based on any criteria you need and mParticle will forward the correct identities for each service, as long as they are available.

The identity API is used by all of mParticleâs SDKs to log users in and out of your app, to search for, and to modify a current userâs identities. It is also available as an HTTP API.
The identity API provides four endpoints for identifying users:
These four endpoints are called in response to different user actions, but they all perform the same function - resolving a request containing all known identifying information for the current user into a single, unique mParticle User Profile. That profile might be:
Identity strategies determine which user profile to add data to when the current user can be identified, and what to do when the current user cannot be identified.
There are 5 identity strategies that have been designed to handle different business and privacy requirements.
Theprofile conversion strategyis designed to help build a comprehensive picture of a userâs entire journey through a traditional sales funnel.
The main distinguishing feature of this strategy is that when a new login ID is received, IDSync will not create a new profile. Instead, it will simply add the new login ID to the previous profile used to store data collected when the user was anonymous.
Thedefault identitystrategy is a simplified version of the profile conversion strategy. The main difference is that the unique ID and login ID for the default identity strategy are set tocustomer_id, and they cannot be changed.
Theprofile linkstrategy is optimized to track the events that drive users to create an account or make purchases.
Theprofile isolationstrategy is built to prevent any anonymous data from being attributed to known users. This strategy is helpful when strict compliance with consumer protection and privacy regulation is required.
Thebest matchstrategy is not optimized to help uniquely identify users. It is best suited for businesses that do not have a login flow or that provide their primary services without requiring users to log in.
Each identity strategy must define the order of precedence for matching user profiles. When an identity request is received, mParticle looks up matching profiles for each identifier in the order defined by the identity priority until a single profile can be returned. Keep in mind that some identity strategies impose minimum requirements that a request must fulfill in order to return a user even if they match (seeLogin Identities). For now, letâs just look at how the identity priority can affect which profile is returned by a request.
User profiles
Scenarios
When Choosing your identity priority, ask the following questions about each of the identities you collect:
There are some input feeds that always include a specific user identifier that you may or may not want to include in your identity priority list. To ensure that IDSync requests from one-off feeds like this can still be resolved even if you decided to omit their specific identifiers from your identity priority, you can configure an additional identifier for that specific feed without having to modify your overall identity priority.
If you ingest data from a feed with an extra identifier configured, mParticle still attempts to resolve any IDSync requests using your normal identity priority list first. Then, if no matching profiles are found, mParticle tries any additional identifiers configured for the feed. If a matching profile is still not found, then mParticle handles the anonymous user according to your identity strategy.
To configure additional user identifiers for a feed, contact your mParticle account representative.
For an example of how feed specific identifiers work, imagine the following two user profiles and stored identities:
Profile 1
Profile 2
Now imagine that we have the following identity priority list configured:
Letâs look at two scenarios where data is ingested from the same input feed with the same identity priority list described above.
In this first scenario, data is ingested from the feed and an IDSync request is made for a user with the only identifier being an AID of9876.
Since AID isnât used in the identity priority and AID isnât configured as a feed-specific identifier, IDSync fails to resolve the identity and the user is treated anonymously according to the identity strategy even though Profile 1 would be a match for the user.
In the second scenario, AID is configured as a feed-specific identifier. Now, if the same IDSync request is submitted for a user with an AID of9876, IDSync resolves the request to Profile 1. However, this will only be successful if the IDSync request is made for data ingested from the same feed that has AID configured as a specific identifier.

Catalog gives you a single view of every unique event, attribute and identity collected in an mParticle workspace, detailed insights into each of these data points, and lets you provide your own annotations.
You can use the Catalogâs List view to:
The list view displays six main categories:

You can filter the list view to display specific data points:
Filter icon: show data points that match the criteria you specify:
Channel: show data points that have been seen for the selected channel. Channel is distinct from input and describes how a data point arrived at mParticle. For example, a data point may arrive from the client side, server side, or from a partner feed. Valid channels include:
Combine date ranges and filters with your search terms to quickly browse and explore data points. Setting a filter will also clear any current category selection.
The details view gives you detailed information on an individual data point, including environments the event has been captured for, and when an event was last seen for each platform.
Users withadminaccess can annotate data points in the following ways:
Your event data points may include attributes, and the details view shows every attribute name that has ever been seen within the given data point. You can see the total volume received in the last 30 days, when the attribute was last seen, and thedetecteddata type. The supported detection types are:

For data points, the stats view shows two important groups of statistics for a selected date:

Live Stream gives you a real time view of data coming in and out of mParticle. It allows you to:
You can filter the data shown in the Live Stream in several ways:
Live Stream shows only development data, but if you filter for a specific device, the Live Stream will also show events from the Production environment. When attempting to match a device to a device ID, mParticle will look for the following per platform:
To save a specific device:
To view the details of a specific event, select the event from the Live Stream list. The Live Stream pauses, the selected event expands to display additional message details, and a details panel is shown.

Data plans help you improve data quality and control across the enterprise:
A data plan is a codified set of expectations about the extent and shape of your data collected with mParticle. A plan contains the following elements:

Use theData Planning APIinstead of the mParticle UI if you:
Integrate mParticleâs suite of Data Planning tools to perform compile-time and runtime data quality verification.
Depending on your goals, create a single plan or multiple plans. You decide whether all of your feeds and inputs share the same plan, or if you create a unique plan for every individual client-side and server-side input. Two common scenarios indicate a need for multiple plans:
Although most of the data planning steps can be completed in the Data Plan UI,Step 3requires a small code change. You must have developer support for the following:
Optionally, you can reviewthe JSON Referenceto learn more about the full JSON structure.
To create and implement a data plan:
Data Plan Builder is a Google Sheet add-on and template that helps you create a data plan:

Choose from one of the industry-specific templates or the generic template.
Once you have the JSON from Data Plan Builder, paste it into the Data Plan import window (as explained in Step 1.3 below), or store the file and upload it using theData Planning API.
To create a plan:
When updating or uploading a data plan by copying and pasting JSON (as when using theData Plan Builder) you must update the version description separately in the mParticle UI.
To start verifying incoming data against your plan, you first need to activate it. To do this, click theActivatebutton on your data planâs home screen. Then in the Activate modal, use the Status dropdown to select the environment in which you want to activate your data plan (devorprod). (You also have the option to save the plan as a draft to return to later.)

Now that your plan is active, you need to ensure that incoming data is tagged with your planâs id. Continue to the next step to learn how.
Before mParticle validates incoming data against the plan, the data must be tagged with a plan ID, an environment, and optionally a plan version. This is the step that requires a small code change, as mentioned inPrerequisites.
To find your plan ID, navigate to theplan listing page. In the following image,fintech_templateis the plan ID and should be used in the code snippets below:

Include the plan ID and environment in all batches sent to mParticle.
Example Code in Four Languages
You can cut and paste the following example code in either JSON, Swift, Kotlin, or JavaScript for your developer to implement:
Now that you have tagged incoming data, use Live Stream to debug violations as they occur.

Once your plan is validating data, violations reports help monitor your data quality. To view violations, clickUnique Violationsin the header row of your data planâs home screen. This will display a violation report like the one below:

Your data needs change over time. Data plans can be easily updated to reflect these changes.
Smaller changes can be made directly to an existing plan version. Updates to active data plans are live immediately: simply update the plan in the UI and save your changes. For larger changes, we recommend creating a new plan version. Creating a new plan version allows you to track changes over time and to revert back to an older version if necessary.
If youâre using aData Plan Builder, make the update in the builder and follow instructions to export a new data plan version into mParticle.

To view the version history of a data plan:
Once you are confident that your plan reflects the data you want to collect, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. Learn more about blocking data inthe next section.
Using Data Plans, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. You can think of this feature as an allowlist (sometimes called awhitelist) for the data you want to capture with mParticle: any event, event attribute, or user attribute that is not included in the allowlist can be blocked from further processing.

To prevent blocked data from being lost, you can opt for blocked data to be forwarded to an Output with a Quarantine Connection. To illustrate a typical workflow, assume you choose to configure an Amazon S3 bucket as your Quarantine Output:

Anytime a data point is blocked, the Quarantine Connection will forward the original batch and metadata about what was blocked to the configured Amazon S3 bucket. You will then be able to:
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle and then forwarded on to an integration partner server-to-server. However, in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all required functionality for an integration, an embedded kit can be used instead.
You can learn which integrations are kits for a given SDK here:
By default, the current Block feature supports blocking for server-side integrations. If you would like to enable blocking for mParticle kits, you need to follow additional steps outlined below for each of our most popular SDKs: Web, Android and iOS.
Before you can enable the blocking feature, you need to create a data plan and initialize the respective SDK with a data plan ID in your code. Read ourâGetting Startedâ sectionfor detailed guidance.
Our SDKs are served by a CDN that caches SDK configuration, including your data plan, for some period of time (the âTTLâ). As a result, updates to a data plan can take time before they are reflected in your client code. To avoid caching a plan version while you are iterating on it:
You can now turn on Block settings for the type of data you would like to block by completing the following steps:
For Web, you can use the developer console to verify when a kitâs underlying SDK uploads an event to the partnerâs API. For iOS and Android, you can typically use verbose console logs or a proxy such as Charles Proxy. Depending on your block settings, you should see unplanned data removed from payloads. For example, if you have not planned âBad Event Aâ, âBad Event Aâ will not be forwarded to a specific partner integration.
Follow your usual software development process to deploy your code changes to production. Remember to also promote your data plan version to prod through the mParticle UI to start blocking production data that does not match your plan. Plan versions active on production are locked in the UI to prevent accidental updates. The recommended flow for updating a production plan is to clone the latest version and to deploy a new version after testing.
To protect shared resources, every mParticle account includes a memory quota for active data plan versions. The byte size of a plan versionâs JSON representation is a good estimate of its memory footprint. The typical data plan version size is approximately 50 KB.
You can verify your current usage, check the size of a data plan, and if needed, take action to reduce your memory quota usage:
Contact your mParticle representative if you need more memory provisioned for your account.
To enable validation, you need to point your code to adata plan idwithat least one active version. For a version to be considered active, its status has to be set todevordev & prod.
You can either pin your code to a specific data plan version or omit the version, in which case mParticle will match the data you send with the latest plan version that is active in a given environment (devorprod). Learn more about how to implement a data plan withGetting Started.

You can plan for and validate the following events:
The following events are not yet included:
You can plan for and validate the following user identifier types:
TheOtheridentifiers allow you to enter up to ten different custom strings against which to validate data.
Hereâs an example schema configuration for a screen event called âSandbox Page Viewâ:

This configuration states the following:
Letâs look at a couple examples to see this schema validation in action.
This eventpassesvalidation.
This eventfailsvalidation since the requiredanchorattribute is excluded.
This eventpassesvalidation: Thenameattribute is excluded but optional.
This eventfailsvalidation: Thelabelattribute is unplanned andcustom_attributeshas been configured to disallow additional attributes. You can change this behavior by changing the validation of thecustom_attributesobject toAllow add'l attributes(see below).

If youâre looking for an example of how to implement events that conform to your data plan, download your data plan and check out ourSnippets Tool. This tool will show you how to implement every data point in your plan for any of our SDKs.
Since various mParticle features (Audiences, Calculated Attributes, Forwarding Rules, some integrations) will automatically convert string representations of numbers and booleans to their respective types, data planning does not distinguish between raw numeric or boolean values (e.g.42ortrue) and their string representation (e.g."42"or"true").  As long as the value can be converted to a type, it is considered valid.
You can validate specific attributes differently depending ondetectedtype. Learn more abouthow type validation works here.
Number can be validated in two ways:

String can be validated in three ways:

Ingestion, plan validation (and blocking), and event forwarding occur in the following sequence:

Use any API client or SDK to send data to the Events API, and tag the data with your plan ID and, optionally, a plan version. For instructions, see Step 1 inGetting Started.
If you are using an mParticle kit to forward data to a destination, and you have enabled blocking of bad data, you can configure popular client SDKs to block bad data before it is forwarded to a kit. Learn more about blocking bad data before it is sent to kitshere.
Your data then passes through themParticle Rules engine. You can use your Rules to further enrich or fix your data.
Data is then validated and, optionally, blocked. You can see dev data being validated in real-time withLive Stream.
Data is then sent to the mParticle profile storage system. When you block bad data, it is dropped before being stored on a profile. Learn more about what happens when data is blockedhere.
Your data then passes through the rest of the mParticle platform and is sent outbound, including:
During plan enforcement, mParticle will generate violations when actual data does not match expectations. mParticle tracks the following types of violations:
The event type and name combination is not expected.
The attribute is not expected on a specific event.
The user attribute or identity is not expected.
This means the attribute is expected, but it has one or more data quality violations such as:
You canât block the following items:
Blocked data is dropped from your data stream before it is consumed by other mParticle features, such as:
For debugging and reporting purposes, blocked data is shown inLive Streamand theData Plan Report. Unless you create aQuarantine Connection, you wonât be able to recover blocked data.
Blocking data does not impact MTU or (ingested) event counts.
To prevent blocked data from being lost, you can opt for blocked data to be forwarded to an Output with a Quarantine Connection. To illustrate a typical workflow, assume you choose to configure an Amazon S3 bucket as your Quarantine Output.

Anytime a data point is blocked, the Quarantine Connection will forward the original batch and metadata about what was blocked to the configured Amazon S3 bucket. You will then be able to:
Learn more about how to use quarantined data in theBlocked Data Backfill Guide.
Weâve developed tools for you to be able to lint your Swift, Kotlin/Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript code. For more information, seeLinting Tools.
The mParticle Snippets tool helps you to generate example code blocks that log events using the mParticle SDKs in a way that conforms to a specified data plan.
For example, if a data plan includes a data point for a custom event with 10 different attributes, you can create the exact code that will log that event with all of its attributes by running the data plan through the Snippets tool.
This is helpful when integrating the mParticle SDK into your app if you are unsure which method to call to log a specific event or how to ensure that all of an eventâs attributes are captured correctly.

To use the Snippets tool:
For example:
For this data point, you must first create the product being added to the cart using themParticle.eCommerce.createProduct()method, passing in the attributesproductName,productId, and19.199for the productâs name, ID, price, and amount.
To log the event, your app must call themParticle.eCommerce.logProductAction()method passing in the product object just created and the product action type (AddToCart).
Visit themParticle developer documentationto learn more about integrating the SDKs into your application.

Although processing and forwarding event data is a core function of mParticle, we are not just an integration platform. Our goal is to help you develop a complete view of your users, across all of your data sources, and make that view available wherever it is needed. The user profile is central to this goal.
An mParticle user profile represents a complete picture of what youâve learned about a given user over time, across all of your channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as you capture new data.
Within mParticle, user profiles serve four core functions:
Use profiles in mParticle to understand users and create personalized experiences:
Inspect the profile for any user in the mParticle UI via the User Activity View. To find user profiles, you can search by any user identity type you capture, or by the mParticle ID. You can also navigate to the User Activity View for active users in your development environment by inspecting a batch in the Live Stream.
For more information, seeUser Activity.
Profile enrichment allows mParticle to make sure that each of your downstream systems has the most complete and up-to-date information about each of your users. For example, mParticle receives data as batches from native SDKs, our HTTP API and third-party data feeds. Each batch is a JSON object containing an array of events and contextual information about the user, such as identities, user attributes, and device information. mParticle processes the information in each batch and forwards it to downstream systems through event integrations. Before a batch from a particular source is forwarded, mParticle compares it to the matching user profile and adds additional information.

If you collect the same user attribute from multiple sources, for example an iOS app and a web app, mParticle accepts the most recent version. For example, if Bob sets his favorite drink to âBeerâ in the web app, and then changes it to âCokeâ in the iOS app the next day, Bobâs user profile will use the most recent value for enrichment.
Enrichment ensures that all of your downstream tools can receive complete and accurate information about your users. Remember that you can still usedata filtersto prevent downstream systems from receiving user attributes that they donât need.
The mParticle user profile can be delivered in JSON format by the Profile API, in order to deliver personalized experiences based on user attributes or audience memberships. To request a profile from the API, supply either the corresponding MPID or a specially configured immutable ID (usually the Customer ID).
For more information, seeProfile API.
Audiences allow you to define segments of users based on rule based criteria of their event behavior and profile data. mParticle builds and maintains these segments of users over time which can then be connected to hundreds of outputs for activation.
Audiences and Calculated attributes are built from all your profile data, including calculated attributes, and events that have been collected across all your data sources. For real-time audiences, these are within the audience look back window. Standard audiences utilize your extended Data Retention policy. For more information about data retention, seeData Retention.
For more information, seeAudiencesandCalculated Attributes.
Two main classes of data provide context about your users and the events they trigger.
User data
User data describes the attributes of individual user profiles. It includes information such as what identities they have, device types and IDs, and a number of custom attributes such as membership status and demographic information. An attribute can reflect either current or previous values, depending on its nature and how often it is updated. User data is stored in profiles.
Event data
Event data describes actions that your users take. They contain information current for the moment at which the event was triggered. For example, the event âSign upâ could have an event attribute of âmembership tierâ, which denotes the membership status at time of signing up. Event data is stored in events.
Each profile describes useful details about the user associated with the profile.

A user profile contains the following elements:
mParticle ID - a unique identifier for the user within mParticle
The most recently seen IP address associated with the user
For each workspace the user has been seen in:
For each device the user has been seen on:
More about the mParticle schema can be foundhere.
Most of the time, mParticle automatically keeps user profiles updated as you capture new data with any of the following methods:
However, sometimes it is necessary to make direct updates to your user profiles in bulk. This happens most often when youâre loading large amounts of data from legacy systems.
To directly update a profile, you can make a standard request to our HTTP API, and leave out theeventsnode. For example:
User attributes updated in this way will not be immediately updated in all downstream event integrations. Most event integrations in mParticle will not process a batch with no events. However, as long as you are sending some event data to each integration, the enrichment process will make sure that user attributes are updated the next time an event is sent for each user.
If it is important for profile updates to be reflected across all your systems immediately, add an event to the batch. For example:
For a given user, attributes are stored at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Once ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonât be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonât be able to set that same key value from a Custom CSV or partner data feed.
You can override the default behavior for input feeds, and specify whether data ingested from a feed creates new profiles or updates existing profiles. Choose from one of three input protection levels:
The default profile protection level for all input feeds isCreate & Update.
Profile protection levels are specific to each input configuration, providing more granular control over multiple configurations even if they are contained in a single workspace.
When ingesting user data from an input, mParticle searches for an existing profile that corresponds with any of the user identifiers included with the data. The identity strategy configured for your account determines if a new profile is created when an existing profile canât be found.
You can prevent unwanted changes by defining one or more input protections.
To set the protection level for an existing input:
When creating a new input feed, you are given the input protection dropdown menu, allowing you to set the protection level for that input from the start.
This setting removes all restrictions from an inputâs access to a user profile, meaning that new user profiles can be created and modified as data is ingested.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it creates a new profile for the user. If a matching profile was found, the data from the input enriches the found profile.
This setting ensures that only data from known, existing users in the workspace is ingested. If IDSync canât find a matching profile (in other words, if the user is unknown) then the data is discarded. Only existing users within the workspace can be updated, and all other unknown users are ignored.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, mParticle will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. However, if a matching profile was found, then the user data from the input enriches the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that donât resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle will drop the data and it will not be forwarded to any outputs. However, this is still a billable event due to the processing needed when searching for a matching MPID in your workspace.
Imagine you have a business with a large customer base, but multiple storefronts or customer touch-points. These various touch-points are housed under separate brands and any one customer engages with many of them.
Furthermore, you have chosen to use a centralized data warehouse to help keep your customer data consolidated.
However, you want to ingest customer data into mParticle from your warehouse while maintaining a single user profile for each customer. To do this, you must prevent new profiles from being created. This is where theOnly Updateprotection level is useful.
By setting your data warehouse input feed toOnly Update, mParticle ensures that as new data for a known customer is ingested, that data is attributed to a single user profile. Without this protection, it would be possible for a separate user profile to be created for each of your brands a customer engages with. This would prevent you from maintaining a holistic perspective of your customersâ history.
Prevents all write access to profiles and IDSync. Event batches are ingested normally, but existing profiles canât be modified and new profiles canât be added to protect user profiles and IDsync records from undesired modifications from the input.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. If a matching profile was found, mParticle will not associate the data with the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that donât resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle ingests and forwards the event batch to other outputs, but it will not create a new profile for the MPID.
Keeping your customer data clean and uncontaminated is critical. However, itâs also essential to be able to test new connections from your data warehouses to mParticle.
To configure and test a new input feed from a warehouse without allowing any ingested data to modify your existing customer profiles, you can set the initial protection level for the new feed toOnly Read. This allows you to verify that data is ingested properly, without any of that data leading to the modification or creating of new user profiles.
After youâre confident in your new input configuration, you can change the protection level to allow data from that input to begin enriching profiles.
Profiles are available for different periods of time, depending on thedata retention policyfor your account.
The Professional Services team at mParticle provides the following guide for enriching your user profiles with UID2 for more effecive activation through The Trade Desk and others. If you have further questions while implementing the guide, please reach out to your Professional Services contact or account manager.

A calculated attribute (CA) measure usersâ aggregate behaviors, and store this information in new user attributes, such as customer lifetime value, total games played or content watched, or the last product viewed. You define a calculated attribute in mParticle and, once activated, they are computed automatically over time by using the raw data stream of events and user information. Once youâve created calculated attributes, you can use them as segmentation criteria in Audiences, Profile API, or connect them downstream to any of your tools. This is incredibly powerful, and can be set up with a few button clicksâno SQL, no pipeline management.
You can define calculated attributes to track almost anything on an individual user, from counting the number of logins in the last 30 days or knowing the last product category viewed, to more complex calculations like the customerâs average order revenue or the most frequent purchase.
Calculated attributes provide value in many ways:
The following video explains how calculated attributes help you quickly generate customer insights without needing any developer resources:

A calculated attribute contains the following elements that you define:
Calculated attributes are defined and calculated per workspace; calculations use data available within the same workspace where they are defined. You can create calculated attributes with the same name and functionality in multiple workspaces.
After you activate a calculated attribute, it initializes using existing data in the mParticle CDP along with any seeded value that was sent usingSeeding API. Depending on the date range selected in the calculated attribute definition, this can take several hours. After initialization, calculated attributes continue to recalculate with new data.

Calculations are eithersynchronous(sent with the batch of data being processed) orasynchronous(sent with the next batch):
We currently support 13 calculations organized into four categories:
For a list of calculations and details about each, seeCalculated Attributes Reference.
For an overview of how to use calculation categories, view the following video:

Calculated attributes can apply to a date range that you choose:
Since: limit calculations to the period of a specified start date to now.

Note that above the date range selection drop-downs, the UI displays the date that data was first ingested into mParticle.
You can choose a date earlier than the first date that data was ingested, however, mParticle only calculates as of the earliest ingestion date.
After selecting an event, you can add conditions to the attribute in order to more precisely define results. For example, a retailer creating a calculated attribute might use the Contains operator with a Count attribute to count only the purchases that contain âSockâ in the product name. For a complete list of operators for the four categories of attributes (Count, Aggregation, Occurrence, and List), seeConditions.
Seeding allows you to pass in historic values for calculated attributes that mParticle builds on as new data arrives, without passing in the raw events. Seeding allows you to transition from your own calculations to mParticle calculation. For example, you may have data from outside mParticle about the last four monthsâ bookings. You can create a calculated attribute, then send the seed data to mParticle usingthe Calculated Attributes Seeding API. mParticle then combines your seed data and live data so thereâs no interruption.
You can seed calculated attributes in both draft (recommended) and active states; the calculated attribute must exist before you can seed it.
Seeding requires two pieces of information:
Note the following calculated attribute behavior:
If a partner supports user attribute forwarding, you can forward calculated attributes in an audience integration alongside user attributes. Different partners have implemented user attribute forwarding in different ways.
For example,Salesforceuses a separate data extension whileGoogle BigQueryuses the configuration setting Send User Attributes.
To walk through several different scenarios for using calculated attributes, download theCalculated Attributes Use Case Guide.

Use Journeys to move away from simple cross-channel engagement toward an organization-wide customer journey strategy. Journeys help you to perform journey analysis, testing, and orchestration in a single workflow:
Because customers interact with your brand in many different ways at many different times, you need to reach them based on their behaviors, and reach them with a cohesive voice to deliver a personalized experience across multiple marketing channels.
You want to design a multistep journey: starting with the users available with the inputs you select, you can apply sets of criteria called milestones. At each milestone a new audience is created, which you can then send downstream for further action.
You can create as many journeys as you need (up to your active audience limit), and delete empty journeys when they are no longer useful. You can also delete milestones and their related audiences and connections from a journey and add new milestones.
At the start of the journey, you have access to all the users available from all the inputs from all the workspaces in your account. You choose the workspaces and inputs you wish to select audience members from, and then build the journey:
The following diagram shows a simple journey with two milestones:
In this journey, all customers who engage with the app are sent an email, and those who open the email are sent a mobile push notification.
Notice the following:
Each step in the customer journey can be split into additional paths. For example, you could define a set of milestones for customers who buy handbags, shoes, or winter coats. Each milestone becomes the start of a new path.
You can also create a milestone for all audience members that havenât fit any previous milestone criteria. This split is called a remaining user split.
The following three examples show the different ways you can use multiple splits.
Powered by Cortex, customer-centric teams can predict a userâs likelihood to churn. Using that prediction, teams can deliver a unique set of experiences for users who have a high likelihood to churn.

In this example, a brand engages high-churn risk users on multiple channels to ensure they get the message. In addition, the brand sets up a fail safe for the users who received an email but didnât open it, engaging them over SMS.
One key piece of user preference is their consent status, what theyâve told the brand about how they want their data to be used for marketing purposes.

In this example, an eCommerce retailer delivers two different kinds of experiences based on a userâs consent to GDPR.
If users have consented, the retailer sends a mobile notification as a reminder to convert. For the remaining users, those who have not consented, the retailer triggers an in-app coupon if the user returns after several days.
For many retailers, a userâs purchase of a product is just the beginning of the relationship between the customer and the brand. After a purchase, the retailer can suggest to the customer many possible next steps to prolong and deepen that relationship: purchasing more products, leaving a review, referring a friend, posting on social media, and more.

In this example, retailers trigger the next best step based on a userâs lifetime value.  For high LTV customers, brands can assume that theyâre fans of the brand, and would be more willing to refer a friend. If the retailer knows a loyal customerâs preferred engagement channel, they can communicates with them there. For the remaining users, those who are not high LTV customers, a retailer can recommend products that pair well with the one that a customer just purchased.
Each audience that you create in a journey provides an estimated audience size immediately, so that you donât have to wait for the audience calculation to complete. Once an audience has at least one active connection, audiences and all parent audiences in same path begin calculating the real size. When an audience begins calculating it no longer shows the estimated size.

To estimate the audience size quickly, mParticle samples the total number of users.
You see the estimated size of the audience with all criteria applied (as shown in the previous image). Estimated audience size per criteria is also displayed on the milestone.
Use the audience estimatorâs immediate feedback to adjust criteria definitions and parameters if needed:
In some cases, you may see different symbols instead of an estimated size:
When an audience is actively connected, that audience is activated and consumes a real-time audience credit. Unlike the real-time audience experience, there is no explicit audience status of Draft or Active. The status is now derived from the connection status.
To view the number of audiences available to you, in mParticle go toAudiences > Journeysto display the list of journeys. The number of activated and available audiences is displayed under the New Journey button:

You can build predictive audiences, which are goal-oriented, dynamic, and adaptive. By contrast, real-time and standard audiences are static and based on historical data.
Create a predictive audience by specifying a user prediction in your regular audience creation workflow in mParticle. The user prediction accesses Cortex machine learning algorithms that analyze data on customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with your brands. You can use predictive audiences to anticipate the needs and desires of your target audiences, and thus deliver more relevant and personalized messaging. Predictive audiences maximize impact by automatically finding the best-fit users for a desired outcome.
In the past, you created a static (real-time) audience that identifies every user who has viewed shoes two or more times in the last week, and sent a coupon to all those users. However, now you can create a goal-oriented, predictive audience that contains all the users most likely to purchase shoes based on an analysis of all the available information, not just one factor (purchased shoes twice before).
When you create a predictive audience, you can choose between two types of results:
For example, if you wanted to know how likely it is that a user will purchase shoes in the next 7 days, you could see that likelihood displayed as a score or percentile:
Creating a predictive audience is simple:
For step-by-step instructions, seeUsing Predictive Audiences.
Predictions are rerun weekly to regenerate fresh predictions.
Predictions created in mParticle have the following limitations:
Cortex is the machine-learning engine available with mParticleâs CDP. To learn more, you can visitthe Cortex documentation.

Warehouse Sync is mParticleâs reverse-ETL solution, allowing you to use an external warehouse as a data source for your mParticle account. By ingesting data from your warehouse using either one-time, on-demand, or recurring syncs, you can benefit from mParticleâs data governance, personalization, and prediction features without having to modify your existing data infrastructure.
You can use Warehouse Sync to ingest both user and event from the following warehouse providers:
Map your warehouse data to fields in mParticle
All functionality of Warehouse Sync is also available from an API. To learn how to create and manage syncs between mParticle and your data warehouse using the API, visit the mParticledeveloper documentation.
Before beginning the warehouse sync setup, obtain the following information for your mParticle account. Depending on which warehouse you plan to use, you will need some or all of these values:
Your Pod AWS Account ID that correlates with your mParticle region ID:
To find your Org ID, Account ID, Pod ID, and Pod AWS Account ID:
From your web browserâs toolbar, navigate to view the page source for the mParticle app.

Work with your warehouse administrator or IT team to ensure your warehouse is reachable and accessible by mParticle.
First, you must create a user in your Snowflake account that mParticle can use to access your warehouse.
Where:
mParticle recommends creating a dedicated role for your mParticle warehouse sync user created in step 1.1 above.
From the Users & Roles page of your Snowflake accountâs Admin settings, select the Roles tab.

Click the+ Rolebutton.

Enter a name for your new role, and select the set of permissions to assign to the role using the under Grant to role dropdown.

Select your new role from the list of roles, and click theGrant to Userbutton.

Under User to receive grant, select the new user you created in step 1.1, and clickGrant.

Before continuing, make sure to save the following information, as you will need to refer to this when connecting Data Warehouse to your Snowflake account:



Navigate to your BigQuery instance from console.cloud.google.com.





Replace{mp_pod_aws_account_id}with one of the following values according to your mParticle instanceâs location:




Your configuration will differ between Amazon Redshift and Amazon Redshift Serverless. To complete your configuration, follow the appropriate steps for your use case below.
Make sure to save the value of your new roleâs ARN. You will need to use this when setting up Postman in the next section.




Warehouse Sync uses the Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing protocol to ingest data from Databricks into mParticle.
Complete the following steps to prepare your Databricks instance for Warehouse Sync.

InSharing identifier, enter one of the following identifiers below, depending on the location of your mParticle accountâs data pod:

Within theCreate sharewindow, entermparticle_{YOUR-MPARTICLE-ORG-ID}_{YOUR-MPARTICLE-ACCOUNT-ID}underShare namewhere{YOUR-MPARTICLE-ORG-ID}and{YOUR-MPARTICLE-ACCOUNT-ID}are your mParticle Org and Account IDs.



Databricks Delta Sharing does not currently support theTIMESTAMP_NTZdata type.
Other data types that are not currently supported by the Databricks integration for Warehouse Sync (for both user and events data) include:
If you are ingesting events data through Warehouse Sync, the following data types are unsupported:
While multi-dimensional, or nested, arrays are unsupported, you can still ingest simple arrays with events data.

You can also create a new warehouse input from the Integrations Directory:

After selecting your warehouse provider, the Warehouse Sync setup wizard will open where you will:
The setup wizard presents different configuration options depending on the warehouse provider you select. Use the tabs below to view the specific setup instructions for Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.

The configuration name is specific to mParticle and will appear in your list of warehouse inputs. You can use any configuration name, but it must be unique since this name is used when configuring the rest of your sync settings.
The database name identifies your database in Amazon Redshift. This must be a valid Amazon Redshift name, and it must exactly match the name for the database you want to connect to.
This is the unique string used to identify an IAM (Identity and Access Management) role within your AWS account. AWS IAM Role ARNs follow the format arn:aws:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path where account is replaced with your AWS account number, role is replaced with the role type in AWS, and role-name-with-path is replaced with the name and location for the role in your AWS account.
Learn more about AWS identifiers inIAM identifiersin the AWS documentation.
mParticle uses the host name and port number when connecting to, and ingesting data from, your warehouse.
Provide the username and password associated with the AWS IAM Role you entered in step 1.4. mParticle will use these credentials when logging into AWS before syncing data.

The configuration name is specific to mParticle and will appear in your list of warehouse inputs. You can use any configuration name, but it must be unique since this name is used when configuring the rest of your sync settings.
Enter the ID for the project in BigQuery containing the dataset. You can find your Project ID from the Google BigQuery Console.
Enter the ID for the dataset youâre connecting to. You can find your Dataset ID from the Google BigQuery Console.
Enter the region where your dataset is localized. For example,aws-us-east-1oraws-us-west-2. You can find the region for your data set from the Google BigQuery Console.
Finally, enter the service account ID and upload a JSON file containing your source account key associated with the Project ID you entered in step 1.3. mParticle uses this information to log into BigQuery on your behalf when syncing data.
Your service account ID must match the source account key.

The configuration name is specific to mParticle and will appear in your list of warehouse inputs. You can use any configuration name, but it must be unique since this name is used when configuring the rest of your sync settings.
Select eitherProdorDevdepending on whether your want your warehouse data sent to the mParticle development or production environments. This setting determines how mParticle processes ingested data.
Your Snowflake account ID uniquely identifies your Snowflake account. You can find your Snowflake account ID by logging into your Snowflake account and finding your account_locator, cloud_region_id, and cloud. More detailshereandhere.
The Snowflake warehouse name is used to find the specific database you are connecting to. Each Snowflake warehouse can contain multiple databases.
The specific database you want to sync data from.
Enter the region identifier for where your Snowflake data is localized.
Finally, you must provide the username, password, and role specific to the database in Snowflake you are connecting to. These credentials are independent from the username and password you use to access the main Snowflake portal. If you donât have these credentials, contact the Snowflake database administrator on your team.

The configuration name is specific to mParticle and will appear in your list of warehouse inputs. You can use any configuration name, but it must be unique since this name is used when configuring the rest of your sync settings.
The value you enter for your Databricks provider must match the value of the Databricks organization that contains the schema you want to ingest data from. This is the same value that you saved when following Step 4 of the Data Warehouse setup,Find and save your Databricks provider name, prior to creating your warehouse connection.
Enter the name of the schema in your Databricks account that you want to ingest data from. Databricks uses the terms database and schema interchangeably, so in this situation the schema is the specific collection of tables and views that mParticle will access through this Warehouse Sync connection.
Your data model describes which columns from your warehouse to ingest into mParticle, and which mParticle fields each column should map to. While mParticle data models are written in SQL, all warehouse providers process SQL slightly differently so it is important to use the correct SQL syntax for the warehouse provider you select.
For a detailed reference of all SQL commands Warehouse Sync supports alongside real-world example SQL queries, seeWarehouse Sync SQL reference.

mParticle submits the SQL query you provide to your warehouse to retrieve specific columns of data. Depending on the SQL operators and functions you use, the columns selected from your database are transformed, or mapped, to user profile attributes in your mParticle account.
If you use an attribute name in your SQL query that doesnât exist in your mParticle account, mParticle creates an attribute with the same name and maps this data to the new attribute.
mParticle automatically maps matching column names in your warehouse to reserved mParticle user attributes and device ids. For example, if your database contains a column namedcustomer_id, it is automatically mapped to thecustomer_iduser identifier in mParticle. For a complete list of reserved attribute names, seeReserved mParticle user or device identity column names.
Below is an example of a simple table and SQL query to create a data model:
Table name:mp.demo.userdata
Example SQL query:
This SQL query selects the first_name, last_name, and email columns from the table calledmp.demo.userdata. In the next step, we will set up the mappings for this user data.
After creating a data model that specifies which columns in your warehouse you want to ingest, you must map each column to its respective field within mParticle with a data mapping.
To create a data mapping, first use the dropdown menu titledType of data to syncto select eitherUser Attributes & Identities OnlyorEvents, depending on whether you want to ingest user data or event data.
To continue with our example user data table and SQL query from above, weâll selectUser Attributes & Identities Only:
When mapping attributes and identities from your warehouse to fields in mParticle, you must always create auser_identitiesoruser_attributesobject first. You can then create the individual mappings for your identities and attributes within these entities, as shown in the next two sections.
To map your user identities:

To map your user attributes:




If you are ingesting event data instead of user data (as shown above), selectEventsunderType of data to synconce you reach the Review Mapping step.



Select the type of mapping you want to use from theMapping Typedropdown:
The next steps will vary depending on the data you are ingesting and the mapping type you select. Following are several examples of how to use each mapping type.



To add additional mappings, clickAdd Mapping. You must create a mapping for every column you selected in your data model.

When you have finished creating your mappings, clickNext.
The sync frequency settings determine when the initial sync with your database will occur, and how frequently any subsequent syncs will be executed.
Select eitherProdorDevdepending on whether you want your warehouse data sent to the mParticle development or production environments. This setting determines how mParticle processes ingested data.
Input protection levels determine how data ingested from your warehouse can contribute to new or existing user profiles in mParticle:
To learn more about these settings and how they can be used in different scenarios, seeInput protections.
There are two sync modes: incremental and full.
The remaining setting options change depending on the mode you select from theSync modedropdown menu. Navigate between the two configuration options using the tabs below:
Following are the sync settings for incremental syncs:
The main difference between full and incremental sync configurations is the use of an iterator field for incremental syncs. Both full and incremental syncs support all three sync modes (Interval, Once, and On Demand).
Select the column name from your warehouse using the Iterator dropdown menu. The options are generated from the SQL query you ran when creating your data model.
mParticle uses the iterator to determine which data to include and exclude during each incremental sync.
Select the iterator data type using the Iterator data type dropdown. This value must match the datatype of the iterator as it exists in your warehouse.
Select one of the following schedule types:
Sync frequencies can be eitherHourly,Daily,Weekly, orMonthly.
The date and time you select for your initial sync is used to calculate the date and time for the next sync. For example, if you selectHourlyfor your frequency and11/15/2023 07:00 PM UTCfor your initial sync, then the next sync will occur at11/15/2023 08:00 PM UTC.
Use the date and time picker to select the calendar date and time (in UTC) for your initial sync. Subsequent interval syncs will be scheduled based on this initial date and time.
Following are the sync settings for full syncs:
The main difference between full and incremental sync configurations is the use of an iterator field for incremental syncs. Both full and incremental syncs support all three sync modes (Interval, Once, and On Demand).
Select one of the following schedule types:
Sync frequencies can be eitherHourly,Daily,Weekly, orMonthly.
The date and time you select for your initial sync is used to calculate the date and time for the next sync. For example, if you selectHourlyfor your frequency and11/15/2023 07:00 PM UTCfor your initial sync, then the next sync will occur at11/15/2023 08:00 PM UTC.
Use the date and time picker to select the calendar date and time (in UTC) for your initial sync. Subsequent interval syncs will be scheduled based on this initial date and time.
The value you select for Sync Start Date determines how much old, historical data mParticle ingests from your warehouse in your initial sync. When determining how much historical data to ingest, mParticle uses to the column in your database you selected as the Timestamp field in the Create Data Model step.
After your initial sync begins, mParticle begins ingesting any historical data. If mParticle hasnât finished ingesting historical data before the time a subsequent sync is due to start, the subsequent sync is still executed, and the historical data continues syncing in the background.
Historical data syncing doesnât contribute to any rate limiting on subsequent syncs.

After entering your sync settings, clickNext.
mParticle generates a preview for Data Warehouse syncs that have been configured, but not yet activated. Use this page and the sample enriched user profiles to confirm the following:
After reviewing your sync configuration, clickActivateto activate your sync.
Any configured warehouse syncs are listed on this page, grouped by warehouse provider. Expand a warehouse provider to view and manage a sync.
To view details for an existing sync, select it from the list of syncs. A summary page is displayed, showing the current status (Active or Paused), sync frequency, and a list of recent or in-progress syncs.
To pause a sync, clickPause Sync. Paused syncs will only resume running on their configured schedule after you clickResume.
To run an on-demand sync, clickRun Syncunder Sync Frequency.
Use the Data Model, Mapping, and Settings tabs to view and edit your sync configuration details. ClickingEditfrom any of these tabs opens the respective step of the setup wizard where you can make and save your changes.

Both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) define that consumers/data subjects have the right to view, update, extract and delete data that controllers & businesses have saved on them. When a consumer/data subject exercises their rights, they create a data subject request (DSR). This page will guide you through mParticleâs support for handling DSRs for both GDPR and CCPA.
This page does not provide legal advice, only a description of how to use mParticleâs compliance-related features. The information provided here is solely for understanding and using mParticle features and is not intended to be legally compliant or specific enough for compliance.
This document uses GDPR language and terminology for simplicity.
mParticle providesdata privacy controlsto help you comply with consent and data sale opt-out requirements.
The GDPR defines three entities involved in data collection, with different rights and responsibilities:
Similarly, the CCPA defines:
The GDPR defines some rights of Data Subjects, including:
The CCPA defines that consumers have rights of:
mParticle is a collaborator on theOpenDSR framework, which provides a simple format for Data Controllers and Data Processors to collaborate towards compliance with requests from their Data Subjects to honor the above rights. This framework was formerly known as OpenGDPR; it was renamed in early 2020 to include CCPA support.
To find out more about OpenDSR, read the full spec on theGithub page.
mParticleâs OpenDSR implementation handles three types of DSRs: âErasureâ, âAccessâ and âPortabilityâ.
Each DSR follows the same basic workflow:
The data controller must log, authenticate and verify the request. If they choose to accept the request, the data controller forwards a request to mParticle in its role as a data processor. The request provides:
This workflow can be managed in mParticle UI or programmatically via theOpenDSR API.
mParticle stores data against user profiles, each identified by an mParticle ID (MPID). To respond to DSRs, mParticle first matches identities in the DSR against observed user profiles. This is handled the same way as mParticleâs regular IDSync process: provided identities are resolved to MPIDs to identify affected user data.
Data subject requests submitted without alogin IDwill not be fulfilled for known profiles that have an associated login ID. For example, if you submit a data subject request that only includes the device ID for a user, mParticle will not be able to find the correct profile to fulfill the request.
When finding the correct profile for a DSR, mParticle follows the same identity resolution process used for general identification requests made to IDSync (the mParticle identity management system).
The exact profiles returned for a data subject request depend on the specificuser identifierssupplied with the DSR and theidentity strategyconfigured for your account.
All DSR requests are scoped to a single workspace by API authentication. If you need to apply a DSR to multiple workspaces, please submit it within each workspace.
To get started, enable GDPR and/or CCPA compliance features on your workspace fromWorkspace Settings>Workspace>Regulation. This will allow you to see the DSR UI. mParticle will honor all requests received via API even with these features disabled.
You have the option to include a copy of the live user profile in access/portability requests. Navigate toPrivacy>Privacy Settingsto include a copy of the users profile with GDPR and/or CCPA DSRs. This is for clients whose privacy teams determine that this is required for compliance. The profiles will include: devices, identities, audience memberships, user attributes and calculated attributes. By default, profiles are not included.

The following video explains how to use consent to control data forwarding with mParticle:

As a Data Processor, mParticle will match user profiles for a Data Subject Request based on any identities we are given. As a Data Controller, it is your responsibility to determine how to accept and forward Data Subject Requests in order to best meet your GDPR responsibilities and manage risk. This decision should be managed in conjunction with your Identity Strategy.
You also have the option of using theIdentity APIto identify for yourself the MPIDs you wish to include in the request and submitting them directly, rather than letting mParticle match IDs for you.
Be sure to consult your internal privacy and compliance experts when determining your strategy for accepting and forwarding Data Subject Requests.
After mParticle receives an erasure request, a 7 day waiting period starts. This waiting period gives you the opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is initiated.
After the 7 day waiting period, any pending erasures are initiated. Once begun, it may take up to 14 days before the erasure is complete. For each completed erasure request, mParticle sends a callback to any specified URLs indicating that the request has been fulfilled.
By default, erasure requests are completed between 7 and 21 days after being received by mParticle. The initial 7 day waiting period provides an opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is carried out.
To skip the initial 7 day waiting period when submitting a data subject erasure request to mParticle, check the option labeledSkip waiting periodin theNew Data Subject Requestmodal.
Skipping the waiting period shortens the request cancellation window. This reduces the total time required to complete an erasure request to between 1 and 14 days after it is received by mParticle.
If you wish to remove users from audiences or from event forwarding during the waiting period, set a user attribute and apply audience criteria and/or forwarding rules to exclude them.
In response to a data subject erasure request, mParticle deletes the data it stored, such as historical event batches, audience data, and profiles.
A delete request will also not prevent additional data concerning the subject from being received and processed by mParticle. If the data subject wishes to prevent all future data processing, they will likely need to take additional steps, for example, ceasing to use your service/app.
Access and Portability requests are treated exactly the same way, as follows:
If you submit an access and portability request for more than one profile using multiple MPIDs, the data for every profile returned will be included in a single file. Since the resolution process for DSRs is the same as the process for IDSync, an access and portability request that includes only a device ID will not return any profiles that are protected by a login ID.
For example, imagine that a user opens your app and is tracked with an anonymous profile, but they do not create an account with a login ID. Later, a different user on the same device opens your app and logs in with a login ID. If you submit an access and portability request but only supply the device ID, then only the data for the anonymous user will be returned.
The data gathered in response to an access or portability request will be delivered in a.zipfolder containing many.jsonlfiles (JSON Linesformat).  The zip may contain:
Note that if no records can be found matching the identities in the request, the request for the zip file returns a404error.
A sample portability response can be downloadedhere.
In addition to the OpenDSR API, users with theCompliance or Admin and Compliance rolecan create, delete and monitor DSRs directly in the mParticle Dashboard.

To view details about a request, click the Request ID number.
You can configure mParticle to forward Data Subject Requests (DSRs) for erasure with one or more integrations.

This detail UI for a data subject request for erasure shows the forwarding status for a request that is being forwarded to three different outputs.
The forwarding status field contains different values, depending on the situation:
In addition to the forwarding status, the identities that were forwarded are also shown. mParticle determines which identities to forward based on the identities supplied in the original request, the identity resolution strategy, and what identities each output supports:
When multiple generic identities of different types (such as email address and device ID) are submitted in the erasure request and:
When a single MPID is submitted in the erasure request and:
In the case where the data in a user profile does not match what was provided in the original erasure request, mParticle will use the information from the original erasure request as the source of truth to process and forward the request.
Once a request is forwarded, mParticle canât guarantee that data is ultimately deleted by the integration partner, so confirm that each vendor fulfills the request.
If an integration supports forwarding erasure requests, the integration documentation contains a section âData Subject Request Forwarding for Erasureâ and that section contains specific instructions and information about which identities are forwarded.
To find all the integrations that support forwarding erasure requests, visitIntegrations.
mParticle retains Data Subject Request records for up to 1 year.

mParticle imposes certain limits on incoming data in order to protect the performance of both the mParticle dashboard and your apps. This includes limits around the length of individual data points, such as event names, how fast mParticle can receive data, and how many unique data points a workspace or account can have.
The tables below list mParticleâs Default Limits. Enterprise customers should contact their Customer Success Manager for custom limits.
mParticle can receive data across many channels, and limits are not always enforced in the same way for each channel. Where appropriate, the details section of each table describes how limits affect SDK data - received from mParticleâs native SDKs - and S2S or âserver-to-serverâ data. S2S data includes data received via theEvents API, and from partner feeds.
The following limits apply to event batches being ingested.
The following limit applies only to data being ingested with an SDK.
The following limits apply to events per workspace or user.
mParticle reserves the right to restrict average events per user to ensure platform quality of service.
The following limits apply to resources in theEvents API.
The following limits apply to resources in thePlatform API.
The following limit applies to resources in theProfile API.
The following limits are explained in detail inData Retention.
The following limits apply to resources in theData Subject Request API.
The following limits apply to resources used indata planning.
The following limits apply to resources in theData Planning API.
The following limits apply to resources in theWarehouse Sync API.
The following limits apply to workspaces, users, and the name length limits for audiences and tags.
mParticle APIs have two types of rate limits in place to protect mParticleâs servers from high demand:
You can configure your mParticle integration to respond programmatically to prevent data loss according to the 429 response header you receive.
Throttled resources include a percentage representation of your current total usage in 2xx response headers. These percentage-used headers allow you to modify your request speed or acceleration to prevent exceeding a rate limit.
An API request that exceeds the rate (speed) limit of a resource receives a 429 response and a header with the format:
X-mp-rate-limit-exceeded: "LIMIT"
where"LIMIT"is the ID of the source of the limit as described in the table below:
An API request that exceeds any applicable acceleration limit receives a 429 response and a header with the format:
X-mp-rate-limit-exceeded: âaccelerationâ
Rate limited endpoints return anX-mp-rate-limit-percentage-usedheader with 2xx responses including the percentage of the limit used. If a resource has multiple limits, the response header includes the greatest consumption percentage of all applicable speed and acceleration limits, omitting any user-based limits.
For example, if a request is not throttled and is subject to both a speed and acceleration limit, and the current consumption is 92% of the speed limit and 50% of the acceleration limit, then the header lists the consumption of the speed limit because it is higher than the current acceleration limit usage:
X-mp-rate-limit-percentage-used: 92
If you receive a 429 response for exceeding a speed limit, reduce the frequency of your requests. Use exponential back-off with jitter and respect theRetryAftervalue which is a non-negative decimal integer indicating the number of seconds to delay your request.
If you receive a 429 response for exceeding an acceleration limit, you can still submit requests but you should slow the increase of your request speed. Use exponential back-off with jitter when determining the new frequency of your requests.

Feeds are a type of integration that allow a third party service to forward event data to an mParticle workspace. Feeds can supplement data collected directly from your app platformsâvia mParticleâs SDKs or Events APIâwith additional data available only from an external source.
Data available from feeds may include:
When planning a feed implementation, it is important to consider if and how you want the data to be forwarded to any event outputs. Event integrations connect an âinputâ, which is a single platform or feed, to a single âoutputâ.
Most outputs can only accept connections from a limited set of platforms. When setting up connections from a feed, you need to know that some feeds can âact-asâ iOS, Android, Web, or other platforms.
Act-as feeds are feeds which mParticle can treat as if they belonged to a single platform. For example, if a feed can âact asâ iOS, you can connect the feed to any output that accepts data from the iOS platform.
When you configure an act-as feed, you will need to select the platform you want the feed to act as:

You can connect an act-as feed to any output that can support the platform it is configured to act as.
Note that for act-as feeds, if you wish to capture data for multiple platforms, you will need to configure multiple instances of the feed â one for each platform.
If you do not see an option to select an âact-asâ platform when you configure a feed, the data from that feed is treated as âunboundâ: not tied to a particular platform. For example, a feed that forwards data about user actions in response to an email campaign will be an unbound feed. These events donât specifically belong to a platform, like iOS or Android, and wonât have the necessary identifiers to be processed as iOS or Android events.
Outputs that only support iOS / Android / Web will not accept data from unbound feeds. However:

The cross-account audience sharing feature allows you to share real-time or standard audience data between accounts within your organization and offers detailed control over exactly what data is shared.
You can choose to share audience data broadly within your organization, or to provide access to only as much data as is needed for a campaign. This feature does not share any data outside your organization, except where explicitly connected to a downstream audience integration.
Permissions allow the account which owns an audience to define what data is shared with any receiving accounts.
Permissions can be set per-audience for each account in your organization.
mPTravel sets the following audience-level sharing permissions:
A user in the mPDine account will be able to:
From your Settings page, navigate to theAudience Settingstab. From here you can view and edit current default audience-level sharing settings or add new defaults.

Note that any changes to your defaults willonlybe applied to any new audience created. Changing your defaults wonât update existing sharing settings for current audiences.
View and edit the sharing settings for each audience from the mainAudiencesview.

Click the details icon to view theAudience Details.

Click the gear cog next toAccess Levelsto view the access sharing settings.

Select an account within your organization to share the audience with by clicking the+button. You can change thepermission levelfor each account via the dropdown menu underShared Level.

Users of an account with âview onlyâ access are able to submit a request for additional access. A notification email is sent to the creator of the audience. If you choose to grant the request you can update the audience permissionsas above. You can also seek clarification from the requester by replying to the email.
You can access all audiences that are shared with you via theShared with metab of theAudiencespage. TheAccesscolumn shows the level of access your account as been granted.

If you have âview onlyâ access for an audience, you can request a different level of access.

To make a request you must provide:

The owner of the audience will be automatically notified of your request by email and may request further details by email reply.
In addition to setting access permission for each audience, you can choose whether to make each identity type available to each account when you share audiences.
For example, you can choose to make Google Advertising ID and Apple IDFA available to a particular account, but email unavailable. These settings are at the account level and apply to all audiences shared from the account. These identity filters applyonlywhen the user hasnât already been seen in the receiving account.
Only users with Admin access can manage identity-level permissions.

Aliasing
Each customer has at least one mParticle account, which contains one or more workspaces. All accounts for the same customer are contained within an organization (org). These three logical containers control different types of scope. For example, The Profile API is set to workspace scope, while the Platform API is set to account scope.
A feed you can configure as if it comes from an iOS, Android, or Web platform (Act as Platformoption in the Feed Configuration). Data from the feed can be forwarded to any output that supports the specified platform type.
Aliasing is a feature that allows clients to associate anonymous customer events to post-sign up events.  Functionally, aliasing performs a copy operation from a source MPID to target MPID. The source MPID is unchanged and still accessible in the system.
This feature is supported by the Profile Link and Profile Conversion identity strategies.
Amazon Resource Name. A complete ARN is required for partner lambda integrations and some Amazon Redshift integrations.
A key-value pair that provides additional information about an event, user, or product. For example, a custom event Play Video might have the attribute ofcategorywith a value ofdocumentary.
A set of users connected to an integration for the purpose of engaging those users. Audiences may bereal-timeorstandard:
If the type of audience isnât specified, then the reference is likely toreal-timeaudiences unless stated otherwise.
A date range for how far back you can look to create real-time (not standard) audience segments, apply event enrichment of profiles, and to keep calculated attribute values up to date after initiatilization. Most lookback windows are 30, 60, or 90 days. Lookback windows are defined in the service agreement and are sometimes referred to as âhot storage.â
Contrast withdata retention.
Amazon Web Services. mParticle accounts are assigned to an AWS region that provides optimal performance.
The basic processing unit for all mParticle data. A batch contains data about a single user of your app, on a maximum of one device. And includes an array of events along with information about the user and device. You can inspect raw batches in JSON format in the Live Stream and User Activity View.
An early release of mParticle products or features. Seereleasesfor more details.
A read-only user attribute with a value that is automatically calculated as new event data is received. Examples of calculated attributes include a total count of events, aggregation of events, the discrete occurrence of events, or lists of unique event attributes.
Customer data platform. mParticle includes functionality for CDP, as well as decision making powered by machine learning with Cortex, and behavioral analytics with Indicative.
A company that isa certified solutions partner or technology partnerwith mParticle.
The type of input by which a batch reached mParticle. Not to be confused with platform. For example, a batch for the Android platform can arrive via three different channels: the SDK, the server-to-server Event API, or an âact asâ partner feed.
Data forwarded directly from a device or web browser to an integration partner. Client-side integrations often require a kit to be included with the mParticle SDK. Some client-side kits have a configuration option to work in tandem with a server-side integration.
Contrast withserver-side.
Seedata retention.
A special mParticle event type that tracks actions related to products and promotions. Examples of commerce events are Add to Cart, Purchase and Refund.
Settings for event and audience integrations are split into two sections: configuration settings and connection settings.
A configuration that defines how data flows into mParticle (input) or is forwarded out of it (output).
mParticle lets you track a userâs consent for their data to be captured. Consent is tracked according to a predefined consent framework. mParticle supports the GDPR and CCPA frameworks.
Machine learning in the mParticle platform. mParticle also includes functionality for customer data platforms (CDP), and behavioral analytics with Indicative.
A key and secret used to access the mParticle Events API.
An event type that can capture any type of user activity in your app. A basic custom event contains a name, a custom event type, and a free-form map of attributes. See alsoatribute.
A feed from any data source including the mParticle Events API. Contrast withact-as feed,unbound feed, orplatform input.
The relationship between a custom event, screen view, or commerce event and the corresponding event in the integration partner.
A definition of how one data model equates to another data model in either the same or a different data store.
A definition of how data objects are structured. In Warehouse Sync, a data model may include a data map.
A codified set of expectations about the extent and shape of your data collected with mParticle. Data plans contain data points and metadata: a plan name, plan ID, version, and description.
An event, user attribute, or user identity that is unique within an mParticle workspace, defined for each type of data received from an input.
A set of mParticle features for working with consent and data subject requests.
The maximum period of time that mParticle stores profile and event data. The duration of the time period is governed by your long-term data retention policy, which is defined in your contract.
Contrast withaudience real-time lookback window.
The type of data contained in an attribute value. mParticle supports the following data types: string, number, boolean, and date.
A type of integration partner, such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift.
Seeenvironment.
A unique identifier generated for each unique device the first time it is seen on a given platform in an mParticle workspace. Some event outputs use the Device Application Stamp (DAS) as part of a fallback strategy when other identities are not available.
Term for the device used to access your app or website. Examples of devices include an iPhone, an Android phone, a web browser, or an XBox.
From the GDPR specification, a data subject request.
An early release of mParticle products or features. Seereleasesfor more details.
Each event batch is associated with an environment: eitherdevelopment(DEV) orproduction(PROD). All development data can be inspected in the Live Stream to enable debugging. You can also create separate event outputs to handle development and production data.
A data point that records an action taken by a user in your app. Events are either predefined for use in mParticle or custom events that require mapping. See alsocustom event.
A stream of data into mParticle from either your own data source or a partner. Seeact-as feed,custom feed,platform input, andunbound feed.
Specifically for Warehouse Sync, a field transformation is a data map between an external data source and mParticleâs JSON schema. Field transformations define which individual key:value pairs of data in an external data source correlate to which key:value pairs of data in mParticle.
A definition that blocks a data point from being forwarded to a particular output.
Send data from an input to an output.
The release of mParticle products or features that are typically available to all customers. Seereleasesfor more details.
The General Data Protection Regulation is a set of regulations passed by the European Union. mParticle provides two features to help clients manage their obligations under the GDPR: Consent Management, and Data Subject Request processing.
Seeaudience real-time lookback window.
AWS Identity and Access Management. Using a custom AWS Lambda functionARNto apply rules in mParticle requires the configuration of an IAM User and IAM Role.
The order of precedence for matching user profiles. See alsoidentity strategyandIDSync.
The strategy that determines which user profile to add data to when the current user (known user) can be identified, and what to do when the current user canât be identified (anonymous user).
You are assigned an identity strategy when your org is created.
See alsoidentity prioritiesandIDSync.
Identifier for advertisers on iPhones. An Apple IDFA is similar to an advertising cookie, in that it enables an advertiser to understand that a user of a particular phone has taken an action like a click or an app install.
A set of mParticle features for managing how you identify your users across devices:identity strategy,identity priorities, and the Identity API.
Behavioral analytics in the mParticle platform. mParticle also includes functionality for customer data platforms (CDP), as well as decision making powered by machine learning with Cortex.
The configuration that defines how a partner sends data to an output. Inputs may be one of several types:
A data point tracked by many mParticle partners, representing the action of a user installing the app on their device. In mParticle, an install corresponds to an Application State Transition event, of typeApplication Launch, where the attributeis_first_runistrue.
The flow of data from one of mParticleâs partners to another. Types of integration include: event, audience, data warehouse, feed, data subject request, and cookie sync. Also referred to asintegration partnerorintegration service.
A component you add to an mParticle SDK that communicates directly with an integration partner from the app client. Usually the kit includes some or all of the partnerâs own client-side SDK. Kits are not the same as SDKs. Also referred to as embedded kits. Kits are typically not needed for server-side integrations.
Each of mParticleâs integration partners uses a slightly different data structure, with different names for key data points. Mapping is the process of transforming mParticle data into a format that can be used by a partner, and vice versa. For some integration, mapping is customizable. For example, if a partner only collects one user ID, you may need to decide which mParticle identity type to map to the partnerâs user ID. See alsocustom mapping.
An integration type in which mParticle runs a secondary processing service for mapping data. These integrations consume credits and are enabled by the mParticle account team.
A unique identifier (64 bit signed integer) that each user is assigned in mParticle to aid in processing identity and profile data.
Monthly active users.
Monthly tracked user, a measurement used in mParticle billing. An MTU is any profile stored in mParticle that has been updated or has generated at least one tracked event within a calendar month. Contrast withVBP.
Each customer of mParticle is assigned an org, which contains one or more accounts. An account contains one or more workspaces. Different features of mParticle are scoped to org, account, and workspace.
The configuration that defines how a service receives data from an input via either mParticle servers or directly from the client.
Generally speaking, a pipeline is a data definition describing the data that flows continuously from a source to a destination.
An operating system such as iOS, Android, Roku, or the web that serves as an input. Contrast withact-as feedorcustom feedorunbound feed.
mParticle representation of a physical or virtual product or service that your users can buy. Products are referenced in Commerce events.
Seeenvironment.
A feature of mParticle that requires an additional license. Submit a request tomParticle Supportto request a premium feature.
A complete record of what youâve learned about a given user over time, across all channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as new data is captured.
A type of commerce event captured when a user of your app buys one or more products.
A set of users connected to an integration for the purpose of engaging those users. Real-time audiences are populated based on recently received data.
Contrast withstandard audience.
mParticle has two types of releases:
BetaAn initial release of products or features thatmParticle expects to make generally available.
mParticle typically offers Beta release functionality free of charge to customers who want to test and provide feedback on future functionality.
General Availability (GA)A release of products or features that have been fully tested and validated for scalability, quality, and usability. Any product or feature not labeled Beta or Early Access (EA) in documentation is a GA release. GA features are rolled out to customers over a period of time.
GA release functionality is available for purchase to all customers.
Rules allow you to cleanse, enrich and transform your incoming data before it is forwarded.
An event type used for tracking navigation within an app.
A code library created and maintained by mParticle to track data in your native and web apps. Note that the preferred terminology varies between platforms. This includes native SDKs for iOS and Android, a JavaScript snippet on Web and various libraries, modules, and plugins used for mobile development frameworks like Xamarin and React Native.
Data forwarded from mParticle servers to an integration partner, rather than directly from a client (such as a mobile device). Server-side integrations typically do not require that a kit be added to the mParticle SDK.
A channel for incoming data such as the Event API.
A premium feature that enables you to define and build audiences based on long-term historical data.
Contrast withreal-time audience.
SeeUser Activity View.
A feed that canât be configured to behave as if it came from a specified platform (there is noAct as Platformoption in the Feed Configuration). Contrast withact-as feed.
A user attribute change event: anevent_type : attribute_change_event.
An SDK uploads an event whenever a user attribute changes to denote new attributes, changing attributes, and removed attributes. This allows for calculation of the current user attribute state for each event within an mParticle upload.
The page in the Activity section of mParticle that allows you to view a detailed summary of data associated with a single user.
Seeprofile.
Value-based pricing (VBP), an alternative toMTUmParticle billing. VBP is aligned with a customerâs usage and scales as the customerâs needs grow.
A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account. An account has one workspace already created; more can be created at any time. These logical containers control different types of scope. For example, the Profile API is set to workspace scope, while the Platform API is set to account scope.
An event is a tracked user action. Examples of events are a user loading a page, clicking a button, or opening an email. Every analysis in Analytics starts with at least one event to analyze behavioral patterns. You can think of events as the âwhatâ that a user has done.
Event properties describe the context of an event. For example, event properties for the event âButton Clickâ could include the device type used to perform the event, the time zone the event was performed in, or the web browser through which the event was performed.
Analytics isnât just about tracking events, itâs also about tracking user. User Properties are the properties associated with the user performing an event, such as demographic factors, an email address, or the marketing channel through which the user was originally acquired. While event properties can differ from event to event, user properties are associated with every event performed by a given user.
Every analysis in Analytics is built in thequery builder. Here, you may combine events, event properties, and user properties to create and visualize an analysis.
Aquery rowis a section within a query, and contains events, event properties, and/or user properties that will determine the analysis. A query may be composed of one or more query rows.
When an event property or user property is broken apart into its components, these components are referred to as values. For example, when looking at the property âPlatformâ, âiPhoneâ and âAndroidâ are potential values.
A value that contains only numbers. Numeric values may be used in calculations. For example, values under the property âPurchase Typeâ containing specific price information are numeric values.
A value that contains letters, numbers, or other characters. String values are not used in calculations. For example, a User ID consisting only of numbers is a string value.
Awidgetis a module on adashboardwithin Analytics. Widgets provide both access to and results from saved analyses. Any analysis built inSegmentation, andCohortmay be added to a dashboard as a widget.
